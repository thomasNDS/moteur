Fingers or Fists? (The Choice of Decimal or Binary Representation)
.W
The binary number system offers many advantages
over a decimal representation for a high-performance, 
general-purpose computer.  The greater simplicity of
a binary arithmetic unit and the greater compactness 
of binary numbers both contribute directly to arithmetic
speed.  Less obvious and perhaps more important 
is the way binary addressing and instruction formats can
increase the overall performance.  Binary addresses 
are also essential to certain powerful operations which
are not practical with decimal instruction formats. 
 On the other hand, decimal numbers are essential for
communicating between man and the computer.  In 
applications requiring the processing of a large volume
of inherently decimal input and output data, 
the time for decimal-binary conversion needed by a purely
binary computer may be significant.  A slower 
decimal adder may take less time than a fast binary adder
doing an addition and two conversions.  A careful 
review of the significance of decimal and binary addressing
and both binary and decimal data arithmetic, 
supplemented by efficient conversion instructions.

Multiprogramming STRETCH: Feasibility Considerations
.W
The tendency towards increased parallelism in
computers is noted.  Exploitation of this parallelism 
presents a number of new problems in machine design
and in programming systems.  Minimum requirements 
for successful concurrent execution of several independent
problem programs are discussed.  These requirements 
are met in the STRETCH system by a carefully balanced
combination of built-in and programmed logic.  
Techniques are described which place the burden of the
programmed logic on system programs (supervisory 
program and compiler) rather than on problem programs.

Shift-Register Code for Indexing Applications
.W
In this communication the use of a shift-register
code with n = 10 is described for calling 
64 wireless telemetering stations in a fixed cyclical order.
 A high degree of redundancy is used, permitting 
a single-error correcting code ("minimum-distance-three"
code) with 64 10-bit code words to be employed 
as the station identification code.  Embedding this in
the shift-register code with period 1023 permits 
the code to be employed without punctuation, each of
the telemetering station receivers simply putting 
received ones and zeros into a shift register.  Each
time the given code combination arises identifying 
the particular station (barring for tuitous error combinations
of very low probability) it has been called. 
 The communication describes the properties and application
of the code in some detail and the finding 
of the particular example to be employed on URAL, the
Soviet-built drum computer donated to the Indian 
Statistical Institute by the United Nations
Technical Aid Administration (UNTAA).

Proposal for a Feasible Programming System
.W
This paper proposes designing a programming
facility (itself involving a digital computer and 
a program) which will assist the preparation of large-scale
real-time programs.  This facility is to 
be capable of preparing programs for any of a variety
of machines having characteristics similar to those 
of the facility's computer.  One of the basic assumptions
is that there will be enough random-access 
storage available to avoid the necessity for segmenting
a constructed program in any fashion other than 
a trivial one.  While this assumption is somewhat unrealistic,
it is intended to provide an opportunity 
to concentrate on the other aspects of program construction.
 The programming system should stress the 
discovery in source program statements of as many errors
as possible, before attempting to construct 
an object program.  Among the computer characteristics
which are advocated are a program interrupt scheme, 
a large set of characters, and indirect addressing.

This paper is concerned with the practical
solution of characteristic value problem for an 
ordinary differential equation.  It is at once apparent
that sequential computers, be they digital or 
analog, solve initial value problems, rather than boundary
value problems, and some mathematical process 
must be found to compensate for the machine's inadequacy.
 A number of other papers have applied particular 
devices to particular problems.  The purpose of this
note is to establish a mathematical framework or 
model for these practical procedures and thus assist in
the use and extension of the ideas in other particular 
problems.

A Checklist of Intelligence for Programming Systems
.W
A remarkable variation exists in the degree
of sophistication of various programming systems. 
 A particular manifestation is the jungle of assorted
devices for reproducing limited human decision 
procedures.  An attempt is made here to begin a systematic
classification of the various devices for 
educating the computer to take over the decision-making
functions of one or many human operators, both 
those that have been demonstrated feasible to date and
those that are highly desirable for the future.

Elimination of Special Functions from Differential Equations
.W
A set of ordinary differential equations which
contains mathematical functions requiring the 
use of subroutines for numerical solution by electronic
computer, tabular data for numerical solution 
by hand calculation or function generators when analog
methods are applied can sometimes be expanded 
to an equivalent set of equations which do not contain
the functions.  This is practical if these functions 
satisfy sufficiently simple differential equations. 
Thus among those functions which can be eliminated 
by this procedure are the trigonometric, inverse trigonometric,
exponential, and many other transcendental 
functions.

Each year electronic computers become more
sophisticated, and the programs they must process 
become more complex.  Because of this,dependence of
those in computing on the skill and experience of 
operators is increasing.  At the same time, selection
and training of qualified operators grows more 
difficult.  To meet the need for a quick, accurate, uniform
operator test and training aid, the authors 
outlined below.  While this examination 
is programmed specifically for the IBM 705 Model II with
two Tape Record Coordinators, similar programs 
could be developed for other computers.

Digital Simulation of Discrete Flow Systems*
.W
The discrete flow systems discussed are characterized
by the movement of randomly arriving 
items along interacting channels.  Programing a digital
computer to simulate such systems utilizes some 
techniques not common in other approaches to physical
problems.  The principal portion of the paper is 
a discussion of two simulation studies that illustrate
some of the programming problems involved. One 
is of an extensive package-handling plant, with the
objective being optimization of parameters such as 
storage capacities and processing rates.  In the other,
air traffic flow and control procedures are simulated 
to compare the effects of alternative control decisions.

A Method for Overlapping and Erasure of Lists
.W
at more than one place in the computer.  That is, 
lists may be "overlapped."  Unfortunately, overlapping
poses a problem for subsequent erasure.  Given 
a list that is no longer needed, it is desired to erase
just those parts that do not overlap other lists. 
 In LISP, McCarthy employs an elegant but inefficient solution
to the problem.  The present paper describes 
a general method which enables efficient erasure.  The
method employs interspersed reference counts to 
describe the extent of the overlapping.

Do It by the Numbers-Digital Shorthand
.W
Present communications systems transmit single
characters in groups of coded pulses between 
simple terminal equipments.  Since English words form only
a sparse set of all possible alphabetic combinations, 
present methods are inefficient when computer systems
are substituted for these terminals.  Using numeric 
representations of entire words or common phrases (rather
than character-by-character representations) 
requires approximately one-third of present transmission
time.  This saving is reflected in overall costs. 
 Other benefits accrue in code and language translation
schemes. Provision is made for transmission of 
purely numeric and/or binary streams, and for single
character-transmission of non-dictionary words such 
as the names of people or places.

Multiprogram Scheduling Parts 1 and 2.  Introduction and Theory*
.W
In order to exploit fully a fast computer which
possesses simultaneous processing abilities, 
it should to a large extent schedule its own workload.
 The scheduling routine must be capable of extremely 
rapid execution if it is not to prove self-defeating.
 The construction of a schedule entails determining 
which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentially
with respect to each other.  A concise 
scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimize
the time for executing the entire pending workload 
(or any subset of it), subject to external constraints
such as precedence, urgency, etc.  The algorithm 
is applicable to a wide class of machines.

This paper describes a section of an integrated
diagnostic monitor system which facilitates 
the checking of sections of instructions or subroutines
anywhere in the object program.  A new method 
of specifying all diagnostic operations in a format similar
to a computer program makes the system convenient 
to use and relatively simple to understand.  The paper
also describes a number of other novel diagnostic 
features which can be included in the system.

Sequential Formula Translation

The syntax of an algorithmic language such
as ALGOL is conveniently described as a sequence

are controlled by admissible state-symbol 
pairs which may be represented by a transition matrix.
This description of syntax furnishes at the same 
time an extremely simple rule for translating into machine
programs statements in the algorithmic language. 
 Sequential treatment, however, is not feasible in the case
of certain optimizing processes such as recursive 
address calculation.

A method is presented for the calculation on a
machine of the moments of a probability distribution, 
necessitating little more than n additions and n references
to memory for each moment, instead of the 
minimum of n multiplication, 2n additions, and 2n references
to memory required by the most straightforward 
method (where n is the number of entries in the probability
distribution).  The method is directly applicable 
when a tabulated distribution exists, as when it has
been computed by repeated convolution; but in this 
case it conserves both time and accuracy.

The paper introduces a new family of codes
for detecting and correcting multiple errors in 
a binary-coded message.  The message itself is arranged
(conceptually) into a multidimensional rectangular 
array.  The processes of encoding and error detection
are based upon parity evaluations along prescribed 
dimensions of the array.  Effectiveness of the codes
is increased by introducing a "system check bit", 
which is essentially a parity check on the other parity
bits.  Only three-dimensional codes are discussed 
in this paper with parity evaluations along the horizontal,
the vertical, and one main diagonal.  However, 
the family of codes is not restricted to three dimensions,
as evidenced by the discussion by Minnick 
and Ashenhurst on a similar multidimensional single-bit
selection plan used for another purpose [6]. 
 A four-dimensional code, correcting three and detecting
four errors, has been developed; the extension 
to higher-dimensional codes with greater correction power is straightforward.

A General Formulation of storage Allocation
.W
Formalization of a general computer storage
allocation process is attempted.  With a given 
computer M is associated a fictitious computer M' essentially
identical to M except in respect to possession 
of unbounded primary storage.  Mappings of the total
storage set (internal and external) of M into the 
direct address set of M' are introduced.  A program
sequence P for M' is termed M-admissible (relative 
to a specific execution time period) if there is a mapping
underwhich P and its effective data referents 
are all located in the direct address set of M.  Storage
allocation is considered as a process of establishing 
for an arbitrary M' program  a sequence of mappings, a decoupling
of the program into M-admissible subprograms 
and a linking set of interludes.  An existence proof
in terms of a completely interpretive M program 
as indicated.  Some special cases are discussed.  Various
restrictions on generality of M' programs are 
considered under which more practical realization
of allocation processes becomes tractable.

Optimum Tape-Writing Procedures
.W
Consider a magnetic tape system with a read
check after writing.  Where an error occurs in 
writing a record, a programmed error routine may either
bypass some or all of the area on tape or try 
to rewrite the record on the same area.  This paper evaluates
these two procedures on the basis of expected 
loss of computer time and develops a decision rule for
selecting the optimum procedure.  The rule depends 
critically on the number of times the tape being written
will be used in the future.  In the case where 
the optimum procedure is to bypass an area, a second
decision-the size of the area to be bypassed-is 
necessary.  A formula is developed to determine the
optimum area to be bypassed for each procedure.

A new 48-bit pseudo-random number generator, suitable
for several computers, was tested statistically 
for randomness to determine its adequacy for use in Monte
Carlo programs.  Frequency tests, distributions 
of certain low-order moments, runs up and down, and runs
above and below the mean were applied to one-half 
million generated numbers lying within the interval
(0,1) and to three sets of integers obtained from 
specified bits within the generated numbers.  These
tests substantiated the randomness of all numbers 
except for the set of integers coming from the least significant bits.

On a Class of Iteration Formulas and Some Historical Notes

The class of iteration formulas obtainable
by rational approximations of "Euler's formula" 
is derived with the corresponding error estimates. 
Some historical notes on iterative procedures are 
followed by a derivation of Euler's formula with the
associated error estimate in a new notation which 
simplifies the error estimate and suggests generalizations.
 The final section considers the Pade approximants 
to the "Euler polynomial" and shows how a number of known
formulas may be derived from this unified approach. 
 There is a short discussion of the "best" formula.

Logic tables are an excellent way of developing
and expressing the logic required in procedures, 
operations, systems and circuits.  A set of rules for
writing and using logic tables is explained by 
means of some simple examples.  Then the logic structure
of a vending machine is given in which two logic 
tables are used.  Logic tables are two-dimensional in
nature, enabling us to fully express and consider 
both the sequential and parallel aspects of logic.  They
can be compiled directly into a computer program 
and so eliminate the need for flow charting and hand coding.

The ALGOL 60 Report,* when first encountered,
seems to describe a very complex language which 
will be difficult to learn.  The "metalinguistic formulae"
admirably serve the purpose of precisely specifying 
a language, but they are certainly not very readable
for a beginner.  However, experience has shown that 
once the report is explained it is in fact easy to learn
ALGOL and to write algorithms in it.  The language 
is so general and powerful it can handle an enormous
class of problems.  It is not hard to learn those 
parts of ALGOL present in other compiler languages: how
to write assignment and go to and for statements, 
etc.  Indeed, a lot of the unnecessary restrictions
imposed by other compiling languages have finally 
been lifted.  But ALGOL also allows many unobvious things
to be written, as we will see later, and herein 
lies a problem: ALGOL seems to have become too general.
 So many restrictions have been lifted that a 
lot of technical details crop up which are hard to learn
and to use correctly.  In this paper some of 
the more obscure features of the language are considered
and their usefulness is discussed.  Remarks 
are based on the authors' interpretations of the ALGOL 60 Report.

Operational Compatibility of Systems-CONVENTIONS
.W
The General Standards Committee of the SHARE
organization has devoted considerable effort to 
the problem of operating a computer efficiently in
view of the growing number of programming systems 
available.  Each of these programming systems has been
coded to utilize a fixed set of hardware components 
without recognizing the fact that others may be occupying
a storage medium required by the first.  These 
incompatibilities are currently resolved by manually setting
up the computer for each system as required. 
 The following set of conventions is being considered
to minimize computer set-up time.  They are of 
sufficiently broad interest that we feel other computer
users should be aware of them. -George F. Ryckman,

   Automation of Program  Debugging
.W
   Automatic Debugging can substantially reduce lead-time between the coding
and the effective use of a complex program. It also enforces analysis of
debugging criteria, resulting in verifiably accurate programs. The programmer
specifies the program to be debugged, memory areas, set of input data, maximum
repetition of loops, and checkpoint information for each set of data. The
executive debugging program the runs the program to be debugged, performing
checking functions and creating a trace record of its own later analysis and
location of errors. Applications are quite flexible, and the system can be used
alone or in conjunction with other debugging techniques.

A Card Format for Reference Files in Information Processing
.W
This paper proposes a card format suitable for
a variety of reference files in information 
processing.  An 80-column IBM card is divided into two
fields-reference material field (columns 1-67) 
and identification field (columns 68-80).  The format
for the reference material is flexible, while the 
format for the identification is rigid.  The reference
material includes basically an index, title, source, 
class, summary and cross reference for each entry. 
The identification includes basically codes for a 
matrix of descriptors, an entry number, and the kind,
major interest, and source of the reference.  The 
identification also provides a choice to identify material
for personal as well as general files.  Since 
this card format is sufficient to identify the material
normally associated with reference files for 
books, articles, programming terms, hardware terms, equipment,
machine systems, abbreviations, etc., it 
is suitable as a standard for card reference files in information processing.

A flexible, large-scale programming system to

realized on the IBM 709/7090 computer.  The system is
based on a master file concept and has provisions 
for accepting, storing, and retrieving both descriptions
and instances of large and complex data sets, 
as well as algorithms defined on these data sets.  Both
data and algorithms may be expressed in a family 
of command and descriptive languages.  The concept
of distinct data descriptions and the content and 
use of such descriptions are discussed in some detail.

A Decision Matrix as the Basis for a Simple Data Input Routine
.W
Currently a great deal of time and effort is
being spent on the development of bigger and better 
compiler languages, multiprogram executive systems,
etc.  Since the implementation of  of new methods 
and procedures is not instantaneous, but rather occurs
by an evolutionary process, we should be concerned 
also with the problem of maintaining, improving and
incorporating new ideas into existing systems.  It 
is with this somewhat neglected area that the author is
interested.  A method employing a decision matrix 
is presented for the handling of a standard systems
programming problem,that of providing a data input 
routine.

Record Linkage
.W
Special difficulties are encountered in devising
reliable systems for searching and updating 
any large files of documents that must be identified
primarily on the basis of names and other personal 
particulars.  The underlying problem is that of making nearly
maximum use of items of identifying information 
that are individually unreliable but that may collectively
be of considerable discriminating power.  
Rules that can be applied generally to name retrieval
systems have been developed in a methodological 
study of the linkage of vital and health records into
family groupings for demographic research purposes. 
 These rules are described, and the ways in which information
utilization for matching may be optimized 
are discussed.

Topological Sorting is a procedure required
for many problems involving analysis of networks. 
 An example of one such problem is PERT.  The present
paper presents a very general method for obtaining 
topological order.  It permits treatment of larger networks
than can be handled on present procedures 
and achieves this with greater efficiency.  Although
the procedure can be adapted to any machine, it 
is discussed in terms of the 7090.  A PERT network of
30,000 activities can be ordered in less than one 
hour of machine time.  The method was developed as
a byproduct of procedures needed by Westinghouse, 
Baltimore.  It has not been programmed and at present
there are no plans to implement it.  In regard 
to the techniques described, Westinghouse's present
and anticipated needs are completely served by the 
Lockheed program, which is in current use.

Computer Pattern Recognition Techniques: Electrocardiographic Diagnosis
.W
The use of programmed digital computers as general
pattern classification and recognition devices 
is one phase of the current lively interest in artificial
intelligence.  It is important to choose a 
class of signals which is, at present, undergoing a
good deal of visual inspection by trained people 
for the purpose of pattern recognition.  In this way
comparisons between machine and human performance 
may be obtained.  A practical result also serves as additional
make up such a class of signals.  The approach to the
problem presented here centers upon the use of 
multiple adaptive matched filters that classify normalized
signals.  The present report fives some of 
the background for the application of this method.

Syntactic Analysis by Digital Computer
.W
This paper provides an account of the Shadow
language that is used to describe syntax and of 
a corresponding subroutine that enables a computer
to perform syntactic analysis.  The input to this 
subroutine consists of a string to be analyzed and a
description of the syntax that is to be used.  The 
syntax is expressed in the Shadow language.  The output
consists of a trace table that expresses the 
results of the syntactic analysis in a tabular form.  Several
versions of the subroutine and some associated 
programs have been in use now for over three years.  The
present account of the language and the subroutine 
contains a summary of material that has been described
previously in unpublished reports and also some 
additional discussion of the work in relation to the more
general questions of problem-oriented languages 
and string transformations.

Analysis of a File Addressing Method

This paper presents a new file addressing method
based on the calculation of an address from 
the identification of a record.  For large recirculating
type files, it seems to be more advantageous 
than customary ones.  The probability distribution of
the displacement of records from their calculated 
address, which is one less than the number of probes
required to address a record, is computed on the 
basis of a Markov chain model.  For the reader not interested
in the mathematics, the introduction and 
the summary should be sufficient.

A Procedure for Inverting Large Symmetric Matrices
.W
In the least squares method for simultaneous
adjustment of several parameters, the coefficients 
of the normal equations are the elements of a symmetric
positive-definite matrix.  In order to solve 
the normal equations and evaluate the precision measures
of the resulting parameters, inversion of this 
matrix of coefficients is required.  Many available procedures
for matrix inversion do not take advantage 
of the symmetry.  Thus, when programmed for a high-speed
computer, all n^2 elements must be stored and 
manipulated, whereas only (n + 1)/2 of them are independent.
 In order to allow a computer of given memory 
capacity to handle a larger matrix, the following procedure
for inverting a symmetric matrix has been 
devised.

In a recent paper, Bellman showed how dynamic
programming could be used to determine the solution 
to a problem previously considered by Stone.  The problem
N points of subdivision of a given interval (a,B) and
the corresponding line segments, that give the 
best least squares fit to a function g(x) in the interval.
 Bellman confined himself primarily to the 
analytical derivation, suggesting briefly, however,
how the solution of the equation derived for each 
particular point of subdivision u(i) could be reduced to
a discrete search.  In this paper, the computational 
procedure is considered more fully, and the similarities
to some of Stone's equations are indicated. 
 It is further shown that an equation for u(i) involving
no minimization may be found.  In addition, 
it is shown how Bellman's method may be applied to the
curve-fitting problem when the additional constraints 
are added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve.

A concept is defined as a class of objects
whose members can be distinguished by processing 
its properties.  Property is defined to mean a partition
of the set of all objects into disjoint classes. 
 The formal definition of a concept is recursive in nature.
 A concept is described by a list structure. 
 A one-to-one correspondence is established between the
recursive definition of a concept and its description 
list structure.  Like the definition, the description
list structure of a concept is also built up from 
elementary list structures by a recursive process. 
The list structures obtained this way are compared 
with the description list structure discussed
by the author in a previous publication.

Person-Matching by Electronic Methods
.W
Record linkage in the updating of files is
accomplished in many establishments through the 
use of a preassigned number, such as payroll number,
customer number, or social security number.  In 
vital and health records, however, a unique number
is generally not preassigned to an individual for 
purposes of reporting services received to the health
department.  In order to determine whether different 
physician reports refer to the same individual, name
and other identification must be compared.  This 
is a laborious operation which is subject to various
errors because of name misspellings, changes of 
name upon marriage, and other problems.  We are interested
in the maintenance of a psychiatric case register 
in Maryland, where many of the reports from over a hundred
psychiatric agencies refer to the same patient. 
 These records must be linked in order to provide unduplicated
counts of individuals under care and longitudinal 
records of psychiatric history.  An earlier paper [1] describes
our general procedures for register maintenance 
by use of a digital computer (Honeywell 800).  Here
we present in more detail our initial procedures 
for the person-matching process in order to elicit comments
and suggestions from persons who have had 
experience in matching.

In this note we propose a method of generating
stationary noise with a prescribed auto-covariance 
function by digital methods.  The need for such a technique
often arises in testing the performance of 
data processing and engineering systems, where inputs
corrupted with correlated noise (of a known form) 
are required.  The technique is quite simple and produces
strict-sense stationary noise which agrees 
approximately with R(t), the prescribed auto-covariance
function (acf), over an interval [-T(0), T(0)]. 
 The method consists of approximating the spectral density
by a periodic process with spectral lines, 
and then synthesizing the periodic noise with random
phases and appropriate amplitudes.  In order to 
simplify discussion of the statistical properties of the
noise generated, the technique is first presented 
in terms of exact harmonic analysis.  In practice, discrete
harmonic analysis as presented in the third 
section is used.

Nonlinear Regression and the Solution of Simultaneous Equations
.W
If one has a set of observables (Z1,...,Zm) which
are bound in a relation with certain parameters 
(A1,...,An) by an equation S(Z1,...;A1,...)=0, one frequently
has the problem of determining a set of 
values of the Ai which minimizes the sum of squares of
differences between observed and calculated values 
of a distinguished observable, say Zm.  If the solution
of the above equation for Zm,  Zm=N(Z1,...;A1,...) 
gives rise to a function N which is nonlinear in the Ai,
then one may rely on a version of Gaussian regression 
[1,2] for an iteration scheme that converges to a minimizing
set of values.  It is shown here that this 
same minimization technique may be used for the solution
of simultaneous (not necessarily linear) equations.

A Modified Inversion Procedure for Product
Form of the Inverse Linear Programming Codes
.W
This paper describes a new algorithm for the
selection of the pivot row in matrix inversion 
when using the product form of the inverse.  This algorithm
has been developed for linear programming 
codes; however, it would be valuable for the inversion
of any non-dense matrix.  The procedures described 
in this paper have been thoroughly tested and have been
in operation on the Esso Research and Engineering 
IBM 7090 computer for nine months.  Substantial computer
cost savings have been realized because of this 
procedure.

years.  This simultaneity has evolved from an initial
achievement of self-searching input and output 
to the automatic time sharing of independently coded
problems.  Several important machine and program 
system modifications were necessary to accomplish this
evolution.  Several additional modifications, 
although not required, were added to facilitate ease
of coding and operation.  All modifications had 
to proceed at a relatively temperate pace to insure that
the basic data-reduction work load of the computing 
center was completed on schedule.  Some educationally
valuable mistakes were made, and their suggested 
cures often pointed the way to useful future improvements
or emphasized some of the basic principles 
of a multiprogramming system.  The material that follows

Guides to Teaching COBOL
.W
The teaching of COBOL can be divided into
three main subject areas.  They are the syntax of 
COBOL, the use of such syntax in solving any given problem,
and programming concepts.  It is generally 
accepted that some knowledge of the hardware and computer
logic must be possessed by the programmer. 
 The teaching problem arises in determining how thoroughly
a student must know the hardware and logic 
for that computer for which he will write COBOL programs.
 Unfortunately, historical data concerning 
students' programming proficiency is almost non-existent
and, at best, difficult to measure.  How then 
might we approach solving this problem?

the National Bureau of Standards has used data 
processing techniques to tabulate and make motion pictures
of vehicle movements in the model.  Each vehicle 
is assigned a digital identification giving points of
entry and exit, type of vehicle, desired speed, 
and actual speed, in proportions simulating field data.

Addressing Multidimensional Arrays
.W
A useful method of representing a function of
n variables is to consider the function to assume 
its values at selected points in n-dimensional space.
 Although this picture is of value to the analyst, 
the elements of an n-dimensional array must exist in
conventional storage as a linear array or vector. 
 The means of performing the transformation of a set
of indices locating on array element in n-space 
to the location (address) of the element in its storage
vector is the subject of this paper.  It is noted 
that the index address transformation is computationally
identical to the conversion of a number from 
a fixed to a mixed radix number system.  Several ways
of implementing the transformation are described.

An Information Algebra - Phase I Report-Language
Structure Group of the CODASYL Development Committee
.W
This report represents the results of the
first phase of the work of the Language Structure 
Group.  The goal of this work is to arrive at a proper
structure for a machine-independent problem-defining 
language, at the systems level of data processing.  The
report is based, for the most part, on a mathematical 
model called "An Information Algebra" developed primarily
by R. Bosak.  It is hoped that this report 
will be read (a) with avid interest by programming language
designers and implementors, and all those 
interested in developing a theoretical approach to data
processing; (b) with interest and understanding 
by professional programmers and systems analysts; and (c)
with appreciation by the businessman-analyst-manager. 
 The authors have not attempted an exhaustive discourse
in this report.  Rather, they have tried to present 
a philosophy to the professional people who are vitally
concerned with providing a working language for 
the systems analyst's use.  They trust that the ideas
in this report will stimulate others to think along 
similar lines.  Questions and comments will be welcomed,
and can be addressed to any of the members of 
the Language Structure Group:  Robert Bosak, System
Univac Division;  Roy Goldfinger (Chairman), IBM 
Corporation;  Renee B. Jasper, Navy Management Office;
 William Keating, National Cash Register;  George

Retrieval of Misspelled Names in an Airlines Passenger Record System
.W
This paper discusses the limited problem of
recognition and retrieval of a given misspelled 
name from among a roster of several hundred names, such
as the reservation inventory for a given flight 
of a large jet airliner.  A program has been developed
and operated on the Telefile (a stored-program 
core and drum memory solid-state computer) which will
retrieve passengers' records successfully, despite 
significant misspellings either at original entry time
or at retrieval time.  The procedure involves 
an automatic scoring technique which matches the names
in a condensed form. Only those few names most 
closely resembling the requested name, with their phone
numbers annexed, are presented for the agents 
final manual selecton.  The program has successfully
isolated and retrieved names which were subjected 
to a number of unusual (as well as usual) misspellings.

A NELIAC-Generated 7090-1401 Compiler
.W
NELIAC systems for several different machines
have been generated using the original NELIAC 
San Diego, in 1958.  A basic "bootstrap" process 
was used to generate all but the first, i.e. the systems
were described in the NELIAC language and generated 
by an existing NELIAC compiler.  This experience has
shown there is no inherent difficulty in "building 
compilers with compilers"; indeed, it pointed out many advantages
in using a POL for constructing programming 
systems.  This report presents the results of a project
completed in May, 1961 in which the NELIAC system 
was used to generate a compiler for the IBM 1401.  The
1401 compiler, which runs on the 7090 and produces 
1401 programs, was described in the NELIAC language and
generated with 7090 NELIAC system.  The reduction 
in programming time and the improvement in documentation
of the system were very significant.

A String Language for Symbol Manipulation Based on ALGOL 60
.W
An artificial computer programming language
is proposed for describing the manipulation of 
strings of characters and symbols.  The concept of strings,
introduced in the ALGOL 60 report, is extended 
by adding: (1) the declaration of strings, substrings,
and string arrays with explicit lengths; (2) the 
ability to concatenate and shift strings; and (3) the
ranking of symbols for comparing stings in Boolean 
relations.  A primer or informal description of the
language is followed by examples, a description of 
experiments with the language on an IBM 704 computer,
and a formal description which, taken with the 
ALGOL 60 Report, defines the proposed string language.

Some Legal Implications of the Use of Computers in the Banking Business
.W
The introduction of computers in to the banking
business has a wide variety of legal implications 
that merit careful attention at this very early stage.
 The industry is highly regulated by government 
and, hence, is subject to many statutes and regulations.
 It also is affected by important common law 
rules established by courts.  The legal ramifications
involve not only the mechanization itself, but 
also the very significant, economically attractive phenomenon
of off premises processing.  It is essential 
to identify and provide for many legal aspects right
now, before systems and practices crystallize, in 
order to avoid the later impact of unanticipated physical
complications and expense.  The legal aspects 
of computerization in the banking business are especially
diverse.  In some states, there might be the 
basic question whether banks are authorized by law to
invest in the new facilities, either directly or 
through cooperatives.  More challenging are questions
relating to off-premises processors, particularly 
with respect to the obligation not to disclose information
concerning a bank's customers, the adequacy 
of fidelity bond coverage, the extent of liability for
improper refusal to pay a check, and susceptibility 
to regulation by government agencies.  Also pertinent
is the propriety of data processing by banks for 
nonbank entities and particularly of the rendering of
that service without charge for bank depositors.

Coding Clinical Laboratory Data For Automatic Storage and Retrieval
.W
A series of clinical laboratory codes have been
developed to accept and store urin analysis, blood 
chemistry, and hematology test results for automatic
data processing.  The codes, although constructed 
as part of a computerized hospital simulation, have been
able to handle the results of every laboratory 
test that they have encountered.  The unique feature of
these codes is that they can accept conventionally 
recorded qualitative as well as quantitative test results.
in any way to be coded.  This paper describes 
how the codes were developed and presents a listing of the
urin analysis codes.  Five criteria used in developing 
the codes are outlined and the problem of multiple-synonymous
terminology is discussed.  A solution to 
the problem is described.  Flexible, computer-produced,
composite laboratory reports are also discussed, 
along with reproduction of such a report. The paper concludes
that even though many problems remain unsolved, 
the next ten years could witness the emergence of a practical
automated information system in the laboratory.

Length of Strings for a Merge Sort

Detailed statistics are given on the length

 It is shown that the strings produced by an 
alternating method (i.e. one which produces ascending
and descending strings alternately) tend to be 
only three-fourths as long as those in a method which produces
only ascending strings, contrary to statements 
which have appeared previously in the literature.  A
slight modification of the read-backward polyphase

sets of machine instructions which are subsequently
executed on the "host" computer.  Techniques are 
discussed for increasing the sophistication of the Boolean
compiler so as to optimize bit-time computer 
simulation.  The techniques are applicable to any general-purpose computer.

Recent Improvements in MADCAP
.W
MADCAP is a programming language admitting subscripts,
superscripts and certain forms of displayed 
formulas.  The basic implementation of this language was
described in a previous paper [MADCAP: A scientific 
ACM 4 (Jan. 61), 31-36].  This paper discusses 
recent improvements in the language in three areas: complex
display, logical control, and subprogramming. 
 In the area of complex display, the most prominent improvements
are a notation for integration and for 
the binomial coefficients.  In the area of logical control
the chief new feature is a notation for variably 
nested looping.  The discussion of subprogramming is focused
on MADCAP's notation for and use of "procedures."

A Profile of the Programmer

in a study concerned primarily with the attitudes 
of programmers toward their careers and jobs.  A very
high percentage of programmers have apparently 
entered their careers by accident; it has proven a happy
choice for most and they expect to remain in 
the field during the next five years.  Their principal
job satisfactions relate to the nature of their 
work, and mostfind their jobs offer high level of professional
interest and good working conditions. 
 Salary and advancement prospects, however,are not as
satisfactory.  More than half report a positive 
attitude toward programmers and programming on the part
of their organizations.  Turnover among themselves 
is attributed primarily to poor management-salary is
seen as the principal motivating factor in turnover

Manipulation and Array Processing
.W
A brief account is given of a notational device
that is very useful in the formal representation 
of syntaxes, string relationships and string transformation
procedures and also of computing procedures 
that deal with arrays of functions of many variables. 
The device consists of the use of certain "continued 
operation" or "collective" symbols that are analogous to the summation
symbol (Sigma) and continued multiplication 
symbol (Pi) of conventional mathematics.

SABRAG, A Time-Sharing Low-Cost Computer
.W
The serial SABRAC computer designed and built
in the Scientific Department of the Israel defense 
Ministry has a 5000-location magnetic drum, main store.
 To avoid a need to resort to optimum programming 
techniques and to increase its overall efficiency the
computer has also been given a 224-word ferrite 
core store from which the program is obeyed.  Transfers
between the core and drum stores and to and from 
the twin paper-tape input and output channels are all
available autonomously (concurrently, time-shared). 
 Multiplication and division orders are also autonomous,
so that the machine may be executing up to three 
orders simultaneously.  All functions naturally are interlocked.
 A number of other advanced orders and 
facilities are also incorporated.In particular, an
"Execute" order permits a temporary jump for up 
to four orders and a second modifier register permits double
modification in general and relative addressing 
of subroutines in particular.  Thus the overall effective
speed of the machine is muchhigher than its 
basic specification would lead one to expect and its
design indicates one way in which the concepts of 
time sharing may be incorporated in "low-cost" computers.

Design of a Separable Transition-Diagram Compiler*

A COBOL compiler design is presented which is
compact enough to permit rapid, one-pass compilation

 Versions of the same compiler for smaller 
machines require only two working tapes plus a compiler
tape.  The methods given are largely applicable 
to the construction of ALGOL compilers.

DESCRIPTRAN-Automated Descriptive Geometry*
.W
Descriptive geometry consists of procedures originally
designed to solve 3-space geometry problems 
by graphical constructions and measurement instead of
by computation.  However, in addition to this it 
unifies and simplifies the approach to many such problems.
 When one can call subroutines that compute 
new coordinates that correspond to those obtainable from
the graphical constructions, there is the three-way 
advantage of the approach of descriptive geometry, the
accuracy of computation and the speed of the digital 
computer.  DESCRIPTRAN makes it possible to program
many problems in 3-space with a few statements; it 
consists of 15 subroutines analogous to the procedures of descriptive geometry.

A Note on Range Transformations for Square Root and Logarithm
.W
There was the germ of an idea in two previous
papers [1,2] which no one seems to have picked 
up in almost five years.  For certain functions it seems
desirable to transform the argument to a short 
range symmetric about 10.1 will give examples of this
usage for the square root and logarithm function 
for both binary and decimal machines.

Use of Tree Structures for Processing Files
.W
In data processing problems, files are frequently
used which must both be searched and altered. 
 Binary search techniques are efficient for searching
large files, but the associated file organization 
alteration but cannot be searched efficiently. A file
organized into a tree-like structure is discussed, 
and it is shown that such a file may both be searched
of the tree.  It is also shown that optimizing 
the value of s leads to a search time which is only 25
per cent slower than the binary search.  The tree 
organization employs two data chains and may be considered
to be a compromise between the organizations 
for the binary search and the chained file.  The relation
of the tree organization to multidimensional 
indexing and to the trie structure is also discussed.

be easily and efficiently processed by a sorting program.
 The internal record formats are discussed 
in relation to (1) their conversion from input formats,
(2) their reconversion to output formats, and 
(3) comparison techniques between internal formats.

This paper describes the application of several
new techniques for sorting fixed-length records 
to the problems of variable-length record sorting. 
The techniques have been implemented on a Sylvania 
9400 computer system with 32,000 fixed-length words
of memory.  Specifically, the techniques sequence 
variable-length records of unrestricted size, produce
long initial strings of data, merge strings of 
data at the power of T-1, where T is the number of work
tapes in a system, and do not restrict the volume 
of input data.

Systems Using Random Access Storage Devices 
.W
The substantial differences in characteristics
of random access storage and tape devices dictate 
that concepts and objectives of computer program design
be considered from the viewpoint of the external 
file medium used.  This is particularly true in the
case of sorting.  In a tape-oriented system, the 
major sorting problem is that of minimizing merge time
despite the limited orders of merge possible. 
 In contrast, sorting in a random access-oriented system
encourages the selection of the optimum order 
of merge from many possible orders.  The latter problem
is discussed in this paper, along with criteria 
developed for determining the optimum order of merge according
to the various properties of random access 
storage devices.  Attention is also given to the problem
of key sorting versus record sorting and the 
possibly serious disadvantage of key sorting on a random access system.

An approach to the organization and structure

sorting and performing other data processing functions
is presented.  The following areas are covered: 
characteristics of Bryant Disc File Systems on the Bendix

for data; and functions of a Disk File Executive Routine.
 The concepts for sorting and performing file 
maintenance processing using the proposed structure and
executive routine are discussed.  Additionally, 
it is shown that sorting can be accomplished
without the use of disk storage work areas.

Read-backward Polyphase sorting provides more

than most other sorting techniques.  Backward Polyphase
produces a continuous merging process from n-1 
tapes where n is the total number of tapes being used in
the sorting process.  Any of the available presorting 
techniques may be used in conjunction with the Polyphase
merge sort provided that the presort has the 
capability of producing both ascending and descending
strings and distributing the strings on the various 
tapes as required by the Polyphase Merge.

Least Squares Fitting of Planes to Surfaces Using Dynamic Programming
.W
Dynamic programming has recently been used
by Stone, by Bellman and by Gluss to determine the 
closet fit of broken line segments to a curve in an
interval under the constraint that the number of 
segments is fixed.  In the present paper successive
models are developed to extend the method to the 
fitting of broken plane segments to surfaces z=g(x,y) defined
over certain types of subareas of the (x,y)-space. 
 The first model considers a rectangular area, with
the constraint that the plane segments are defined 
over a grid in the (x,y)-space.  It is then shown how
this model may be incorporated into an algorithm 
that provides successive approximations to optimal fits
for any type of closed area.  Finally, applications 
are briefly described.

This note is concerned with details of how to
instruct a computer to choose one from many things 
with assigned probabilities.  The method uses a uniform
variable to direct the computer to a memory location; 
if this is done by a sequence of appropriately chosen
conditional probabilities, efficient use of memory 
space and quite fast programs will result.

FORTRAN Subroutines for Time Series Analysis

The authors have recently been concerned in a
time-series study that constituted a fairly typical 
piece of applied statistical research, involving extensive
computations on a moderately large quantity 
of data.  Wehave found that the many different numerical
processes that were required could be built 
up almost completely from a small number of basic operations,
and a set of FORTRAN subroutines has been 
written to perform these.  The main purpose of this
note is to describe these subroutines, but since 
the question of general statistical programs is
topical [1], we include some general remarks.

Storage and Search Properties of a Tree-Organized Memory System
.W
A memory with list properties [1] may be used
to construct numeric, alphabetic or alphanumeric 
trees.  Such trees have information storage and retrieval
properties applicable to problems involving 
large quantities of data or to problems where the quantity,
word length and distribution of stored information 
is not known a priori, or changes rapidly during the processing.
 The purpose of this paper is to examine 
the storage and search properties of a tree-organized
storage system assuming that a memory possessing 
certain list properties is available.  Of prime interest
is the application where a symbol table, dictionary 
or similar file is to be stored and searched.

Integer and Signed Constants in ALGOL

A few remarks are given on the relations between
syntax and semantics in the programming languages. 
 The aim is to point out that, if it is true that the grammar
of a context-free language should be conceived 
not only as a strings-generating device but also as a
method for expressing a meaning, then the grammar 
of ALGOL is open to some criticism.

Parallel Methods for Integrating Ordinary Differential Equations
.W
This paper is dedicated to the proposition that,
in order to take full advantage for real-time 
computations of highly parallel computers as can be
expected to be available in the near future, much 
of numerical analysis will have to be recast in a more
"parallel" form.  By this is meant that serial 
algorithms ought to be replaced by algorithm which
consist of several subtasks which can be computed 
without knowledge of the results of the other subtasks. 
As an example, a method is proposed for "parallelizing" 
the numerical integration of an ordinary differential
equation, which process, by all standard methods, 
is entirely serial.

over the on-line data link is used to update the data files
which are stored on disk.  The 473L programming 
 These priorities permit the system to be most sensitive
to the console inputs and permit the operators 
at all the consoles to time share the central processor.

paper is on the technique of using the definition of a

A Rapid Method for Digital Filtering

Since much of the computer time spent in time-series
analysis is used for multiplications, 
a minimum multiplication method was devised for digital
filtering, with the expectation that it would 
be useful in the on line, real-time analysis of biological
data.  The filters are constructed from a succession 
of readily analyzable components in a manner that facilitates
cascading.  The repertoire of frequency 
response curves includes relatively good low-pass and
band-pass designs.  Programs are available for 
implementing both the synthesis of these filters, and
their application on computers whose assemblers 
allow the definition of recursive macros.

A Computer Analysis Method For Thermal Diffusion in Biochemical Systems
.W
In the thermal detection of rapid biochemical
reactions it is necessary to correct the temperature 
data for transient heat conduction losses in a cylindrical
calorimeter.  To handle the complexities arising 
from varying thermal-relaxation times of concentric insulating
layers, a computer program was developed 
which gives the temperature distribution of the system
as a function of radius and time.  This distribution 
is corrected at each step by a subroutine which calculates
the instantaneous chemical state of there 
action, as well as the heat produced by this reaction.
 The program is based on a direct statement of 
Fourier's law of heat conduction and the chemical rate
equation to provide a "bookkeeping law" to follow 
the reactants and the flow of heat packets, in such a
way that the computer continually stores the heat 
distribution.  A computer analysis method is here regarded
as one in which the physical laws of a process 
are used explicitly in the program. Usually this results
in by passing much of the mathematical procedures 
conventionally used.  The program was tested against
some known exact solutions of the heat equation 
and gave identical results, and compared well with experimental
data of a known biochemical reaction. 
 The construction of computer programs based on the direct
statement of the physical laws is a principle 
of general applicability which has been applied
to several other physical phenomena.

Formal Parsing Systems
.W
Automatic syntactic analysis has recently become
important for both natural language data processing 
and syntax-directed compilers.  A formal parsing system
G = (V,u,T,R) consists of two finite disjoint 
vocabularies, V and T, a many-many map, u, from V onto
T, and a recursive set R of strings in T called 
syntactic sentence classes.  Every program for automatic
syntactic analysis determines a formal parsing 
system.  A directed production analyzer (I,T,X,p) is a
nondeterministic pushdown-store machine with internal 
vocabulary I, input vocabulary T, and all productions
of p in the form:  (Z,a) -> aY1 ... Ym where  Z, 
Yi are elements of the set I and a is an element of the
set T.  Every context-free language can be analyzed 
by a directed production analyzer.  The Kuno-Oettinger
multiple-path syntactic analyzer for English is 
a concrete example of a directed production analyzer
and of a working parsing algorithm.  The connection 
between structures assigned by the analyzer and those of
a conventional phrase structure grammar is examined 
in this paper.

A major problem in using the analysis of variance,
as the number of factors increases, is the 
exponential rise in the number of interactions.  Even
though the experimenter may not be interested in 
these interactions it is impossible to ignore them in

of getting error terms.  It is natural therefore to look
to the computer to handle the bulk of work involved 
in computing the interactions.  A program device
to get the computer to do this is described.

A Method of Syntax-Checking ALGOL 60
.W
A syntax checker was designed based on the syntax
of ALGOL as described in the ALGOL 60 Report 
[Communications of the ACM, May, 1960].  Since the definition
of the elements of the language is recursive 
it seemed most desirable to design the syntax checker
as a set of mutually recursive processors tied 
together by subroutines which perform certain bookkeeping
functions.  Because of the recursive nature 
of the language and of the syntax checker the problem
of recovery after an error required much attention. 
 A method was devised which permits most programs
to be checked completely despite errors.

A Simple Automatic Derivative Evaluation Program
.W
A procedure for automatic evaluation of total/partial
derivatives of arbitrary algebraic functions 
is presented.  The technique permits computation of
numerical values of derivatives without developing 
analytical expressions for the derivatives.  The key
to the method is the decomposition of the given 
function, by introduction of intermediate variables,
into a series of elementary functional steps.  A 
library of elementary function subroutines is provided
for the automatic evaluation and differentiation 
of these new variables.  The final step in this process
produces the desired function's derivative.  
The main feature of this approach is its simplicity.
 It can be used as a quick-reaction tool where the 
derivation of analytical derivatives is laborious and
also as a debugging tool for programs which contain 
derivatives.

Theoretical Considerations in Information Retrieval Systems
.W
Information storage and retrieval systems are composed
of three major components: (a) identification 
of information and tagging it for effective retrieval,
(b) searching strategy, how to enter the file 
to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material, and
(c) file organization to make access to information 
efficient.  For identification of information the paper
suggests that a metalanguage (recently discussed 
in a paper by Goffman, Verhoeff and Belzer) associated
with an object language be used.  For searching 
strategy, a linear model for an evaluation function
of relevancy is developed which rewards the system 
for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving
the nonrelevant, and penalizes the system for the 
escaped relevant documents and false drops.  The inadequacies
of a linear model are indicated.  Two approaches 
to file organization are discussed.  One is self-organization
of the file based on its history and past 
performance, and the second is a self-generating subset
of the file with a high probability of being 
relevant.

Multiword List Items

use of two or more consecutive words as one element. 
 Such use results in a considerable saving in both the
space required to hold a given amount of data, 
and in the execution time required to perform a given
process on the data.  Following a brief description 
of standard list structures with single-word items, the
multiword items are introduced.  Then variable-length 
items are described, along with the corresponding space-utilization
problems.  Finally, several examples 
are given to illustrate the use of multiword lists. This

Symbol Manipulation in FORTRAN-SASP I Subroutines
.W
A set of subroutines for use in FORTRAN are
described whose purpose is to synthesize output 
strings from (i) input strings which have been analyzed
by the SHADOW general syntactic analysis subroutine 
reported earlier, and/or (ii) packed BCD strings formed
in any way.  Function-type subroutines are included 
for intermediate manipulations, which are performed
on the strings which are stored in an abbreviated 
internal representation.  The automatic way in which
an internal representation for each newly created 
substring is stored sequentially in a block of common
storage, and the manner in which a storage block 
is dynamically allocated for that purpose, are discussed.

Growing Applications of Linear Programming
.W
Use of linear programming models has grown so
extensively in recent years that the whole concept 
for organizing a computer code has undergone a radical
change.  It no longer is adequate merely to reduce 
a mathematical algorithm (i.e. the simplex method) to
a computer code.  An advanced code must cope with 
such a variety of situations that the respective computer
subprograms must be organized into an integrated 
system.  Emphasis in this paper is devoted to the underlying
principles upon which future linear programming 
systems must be based.  These viewpoints are influenced
by the new demands that applications within the 
petroleum industry are placing on such systems.  Some
of the components of such a system are: translation 
of problem statement in terms of basic data to linear
programming matrix coefficients, data transmission 
for direct computer entry, data file at the computer center,
data processing and editing prior to solving 
the simplex algorithm, an efficient and reliable code
for solving the above-mentioned algorithm, and 
flexible means for summarizing the results.

Computer-Usage Accounting for Generalized Time-Sharing Systems

The current development of general time-sharing
systems requires a revision of accounting procedures 
for computer usage. Since time-sharing system users
operate concurrently, it is necessary to be more 
precise as to the amount of computer time and storage
space that a user actually utilizes.  The various 
cost factors which should be considered for computer usage
accounting in generalized time-sharing systems

(Including a Detailed Comparison of COMIT, 
IPL-V, LISP 1.5, and SLIP)
.W
A detailed comparison is presented of COMIT,
IPL-V, LISP 1.5 and SLIP - four well-known computer 
programming languages which, among them, exhibit all the
principal characteristics of existing list-processing 
languages.  Important common features of list-processing
languages are reviewed: forms of data structures 
which are manipulated, necessity for dynamic allocation
of storage, use of pushdown stores, and use of 
recursive operations.  Principal differences between the
four languages under consideration are detailed: 
representations of data, both by the programmer and within
the machine; methods for storage allocation; 
programming formalisms and special processes available,
including arithmetic facilities; and usability 
in terms of availability, documentation, learning aids
and debugging facilities.  A rough comparison 
shows that all the languages discussed have approximately
the same speed.  Finally, the authors give 
some heuristics to aid in the selection of one of these
languages for use in particular problem applications, 
concluding that no one of the languages considered is
distinctly superior in all possible list-processing 
applications.

Professional Computer Work for the Blind
.W
Developments in computer technology have opened
new professional opportunities for the intelligent 
blind.  Since there are few if any occupations in which the
blind can participate without serious disadvantage, 
the opportunities offered them to gain entrance into
various occupations through computer use including 
that of programmer, is important for future rehabilitation
planning. Also of immediate interest is the 
fact that the blind may be especially suited for programming
work.  Because of intense training in and 
constant experience with locating objects in the unseen
environment and also because of superbly trained 
memory, the blind brings to the work of programming skills
which the sighted has had little need to acquire. 
 These qualifications should result in fewer debugging
problems and make the blind a valuable addition 
to any systems group.  Before the blind could become a
serious professional, a number of aids and techniques 
had to be developed that can mediate between machines
and programmer.  This paper describes the techniques 
and aids which were designed by the staff of the Medical

Digital Data Processor for Tracking the Partially Illuminated Moon*
.W
A study of lunar tracking techniques and fabrication
of a breadboard to assess the feasibility 
of the best technique selected was conducted to define
a tracking system for observation of the sight line 
to the center of a partially illuminated moon.  The
data processing portion of the system is presented 
in detail and then described in general are the operation
of the tracker head assembly for data readout, 
the operation of the entire system and the effect data
processing considerations have on the design of 
the tracker system.  The system basically consists of
an optical sensor, digital computer and tracker 
drive mechanism.  The three system units, connected
in cascade, comprise the control loop.  For this 
application, an optical telescope with a radial mechanical
scanning mechanism was used that read out 
lunar sight line measurement information.  This information
is sequentially read into a special purpose 
digital computer that extracts the measurements and
computes the error signals that drive the tracker 
to the appropriate attitude.

The problem of compiling efficient 6600 codes
prompted the development of an intermediate language 
reflecting the structure of the machine, that is more
easily manipulated in improving object program 
efficiency.  The subject of this paper is the intermediate
language and methods of manipulating it.  
Compilations of a series of arithmetic statements are
discussed.  It is assumed that all functions and 
exponentials have been removed from these statements,
and replaced by simple variables.  For purposes 
of simplicity the treatment of subscripts is ignored. 
A simplified 6600 structure is presented to illustrate
the compiling method.  Several assumptions are made
for purposes of simplification, although there are 
cases in which the assumptions are violated in the actual machine.

A General Business-Oriented Language Based on Decision Expressions*
.W
The structure of a digital compute programming
language which covers a wide class of business 
and file processing applications is presented.  Such
a structure, based on identifying and incorporating 
into a compiler the aspects common to all processes
of such class, permits writing extremely compact 
programs, even for comparatively complex applications,
in terms of tables of control expressions which 
express only information characteristic of the particular
application.  Furthermore,local changes of 
a process (e.g. changes affecting only one of the output
files involved) can be effected by local modifications 
in the program (e.g. modification of only one entry of the
tables).  This structure also allows for inexpensive 
preparation of loading-speed compilers which translate the
source programs into efficient machine codes. 
 The approach adopted here departs from conventional mechanical
language design philosophies.  It stresses 
the structural analysis of the class of processes to be represented
in the languages, as opposed to emphasizing 
formal (i.e., contents-independent) syntactical definitions.
 It relies exclusively on nonprocedural 
representation of process as sets (tables) of relations
between data and results (there are no control 
statements such as GO TO, etc.), instead of using procedure
descriptions (which are one-to-one translations 
of flowcharts).  Here an invariant pattern of procedure
is identified as characteristic of the class 
of all batch file processes.  This new philosophy has
the potential to overcome well-known deficiencies 
of other business-oriented languages and fully meets
the requirements set by CODASYL for such languages, 
including machine-independence.

Analysis of Decay-Type Data*
.W
A comparative study has been made of a variety
of numerical techniques for fitting experimental 
data of the decay type by forms involving the sums of
exponentials.  Statistical errors of the fitted 
parameters are also calculated.  These methods have been
applied to artificially-generated sets of data 
as well as to the results of experiments with radioactive
tracers on both human and animal subjects. 
 Results show that the values of the fitted parameters
are very sensitive to variations in the fitting 
procedure.  Therefore great care very sensitive to variations
in the fitting procedure.  Therefore great 
care must be exercised in identifying such values with
physical constants.  Although the values of functions 
derived from these fitted parameters which can definitely
be associated with physical entities are generally 
more stable under variations in the fitting techniques,
error bounds can be so large that no great confidence 
can be placed even in them.  It would therefore appear
best to select a uniform technique both for running 
the experiments and for analyzing the data, and then
to consider as significant only relative results 
between one subject and the next.

Given a pair of directed line graphs, the problem
of ascertaining whether or not they are isomorphic 
is one for which no efficient algorithmic solution is known.
 Since a straightforward enumerative algorithm 
might require 40 years of running time on a very high
speed computer in order to compare two 15-node 
graphs, a more sophisticated approach seems called
for.  The situation is similar to that prevailing 
in areas such as game-playing and theorem-proving, where
practical algorithms are unknown (for the interesting 
cases), but where various practical though only partially
successful techniques are available.  Git-Graph 
Isomorphism Tester-incorporates a variety of processes

An Assembly Language for Reprogramming

Complete reprogramming of compiler language programs
is seldom necessary.  It is assembly language 
programs which present the greatest difficulty.  Assembly
languages generally provide a one-for-one translation

is, from assembly language to machine language. 
 The meta-language presented here can be used to specify
the mapping of any language which conforms to 
a canonical list form into an arbitrary stream of bits.
 This bit stream may be treated as a machine 
language program, a character stream, or whatever else
the user might desire.  Thus, this meta-language 
can be used to map from one assembly language into another
or from the assembly language for one machine 
into the machine language of another.

a value of an integer function F.  The algorithm 
finds a local minimum of F by evaluating the set {Delta

corresponding to the least negative increment of 
{Delta F} is performed.  The process is iterated and stopped

Analyzing English Syntax with a Pattern-Learning Parser
.W
A dependency analysis system based on pattern
recognition and learning logic was developed 
to infer word classes and rules of syntactic combination
from experience with text which had been analyzed. 
 The characteristics used to form word classes are the
depth in the dependency tree of each word, the 
direction of its governor and the same features for
each of its immediate neighbors. Syntactic rules 
of combination show the relation of a word to its governor
in the depth pattern of the sentence.  The 
system was tested on 400 elementary basic English sentences
a different learning parser of all 400 sentences.  After
experience with 300 sentences it was able to 
generalize with 77 percent accuracy to the next 100.
 In accumulative learning trials after the first 
200 sentences it averaged a probability of .9 for accurately
parsing each new sentence it encountered. 
 It was concluded that the system is adequate for learning
to parse the bulk of basic English but that 
further development is required before conclusions about
its application to ordinary English can be stored. 
 The system is operational and available on
the ARPA/SDC time-shared computing system.

 In little more than half of the 32k word core memory
PUFFT provides a monitor for job sequencing, a 
translator for the full FORTRAN IV language, the FORTRAN
subroutine library, an input--output system 
for use at compile time and at execute time, and a rather
elaborate diagnostic message writing routine. 
 Batches of small- and medium-sized FORTRAN IV source
language programs are processed at very high speeds. 
 Language compatibility has been maintained so that
programs may be debugged in the PUFFT system and 
then recompiled and run in the IBJOB-IBFTC system supplied by the manufacturer.

AXLE: An Axiomatic Language for String Transformations
.W
 A transformation consists of a matching 
procedure, which decides where an imperative is applicable,
and a replacement procedure that modifies 
that part of the workspace.  Imperatives are applied
in accordance with definitions of symbolic terms, 
presented systematically in an assertion table.  The
process of definition includes the special case 
of recursive assertions.  Several complete programs
of imperatives are given to show a few applications
of the language.

language by making use of an ALGOL-like programming 
language is presented.  A computer designer can benefit
from using a design language at a higher level 
just as a computer user can benefit from a higher level
programming language.  The purposes and requirements

a design of computer logic into a set of Boolean equations.
 The design language is presented in terms 
of vocabulary, statements, sequences and microprogram.
 Included are examples of identifiers, expressions 
with both unary and binary operators, declaration statements,
transfer statements, terminal statements,

Establishment of the ACM Repository and Principles
of the IR System Applied to its Operation
.W
The history of the establishment of the ACM Repository
at the Moore School, University of Pennsylvania, 
is reviewed briefly.  Two principles are presented as
paramount in the provision of information services: 
(1) easy accessibility to the information files by users
unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value 
of service exceeding user costs.  These principles serve
as guides in mechanizing the ACM Repository. 
 The main features of the information system are direct
user access via on-line teletypewriter console, 
direct user access to all details of the system organization,
unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, 
user access through many facets of document indexing,
and stochastic search through linked index terms 
and other file relationships.  The first contribution
to the ACM Repository consisted of 315 documents, 
relating primarily to early research on compilers.  These
documents have been cataloged and indexed and 
 The indexing system is described in detail. 
 The Main Catalog is used to describe the documents,
and inverted lists are provided by the Repository 
system for retrieval by concept coordination.

A computer-oriented method for processing and
communicating numerical data is described.  The 
Instrument Reliability Factors (IRF), which exactly
define the limits of reliability of each measured 
item of information, are used to compute the Maximum
Permitted Error (MPE) associated with each values 
of each ordinate.  The Self-Judgment Principle (SJP)
is used to discard wrong information and to compute 
mean values of the parameters and their MPE's in terms
of the IRF.  Data compatibility tests with any 
number of different equations can be made quickly. 
Otherwise intractable problems are easily solved, 
and the design of many experiments is greatly simplified.
 The computational and mathematical techniques 
used to reduce bias in the SJP are discussed.  Inadequacies
in the statistical and graphical methods 
of curve fitting are noted.

calculable expressions from loops and to do the

 Optimization such as the effective use of index

enables the generation of code for expressions

at run time, while properly trating recursion 
and side effects of procedures.  Block structure and
recursion are handled without need for interpretive 
methods at run times.  The "context problem" in the transmission

"called by name" is solved in a manner which permits the

 About half of the word-events in a corpus are identified
through the use of a small dictionary of function 
words and frequently occurring lexical words.  Some suffix
tests and logical-decision rules are employed 
to code additional words.  Finally, the remaining words
are assigned to one class or another on the basis 
of the most probable form classes to occur within the already
identified contexts.  The conditional probabilities 
used as a basis for this coding were empirically derived
from a separate hand-coded corpus.On preliminary 
trials, the accuracy of the coder was 91% to 93%, with
obvious ways of improving the algorithm being 
suggested by an analysis of the results.

Conversion of Decision Tables To Computer Programs
.W
Several translation procedures for the conversion
of decision tables to programs are presented 
and then evaluated in terms of storage requirements,
execution time and compile time.  The procedures 
are valuable as hand-coding guides or as algorithms for
a compiler.  Both limited-entry and extended-entry 
tables are analyzed.  In addition to table analysis,
the nature of table-oriented programming languages 
and features is discussed.  It is presumed that the reader
is familiar with the nature of decision tables 
and conventional definitions.

A Technique for Integrated Reports from a Multi-run System
.W
The requirements of a requisition accounting
system for the San Francisco Overseas Supply Agency 
(OSA) included exception reporting to OSA itself.  The simultaneous
satisfaction of the reporting requirement 
and the accounting requirements posed definite problems
in system design, particularly the handling of 
the reporting function.  A practical and satisfactory
solution was developed by expanding the basic system 
with two tailored service runs for report production.
 These two runs permitted a final system that was 
easier to debug, easy to maintain, efficient in production
and responsive to the changing requirements
of OSA.

A number of diverse recognition procedures
that have been proposed for parsing sentences with 
respect to a context-free grammar are described in this
paper by means of a common device.  Each procedure 
is defined by giving an algorithm for obtaining a nondeterministic
Turing Machine recognizer that is 
equivalent to a given context-free grammar.  The formalization
of the Turing Machine has been chosen 
to make possible particularly simple description of
the parsing procedures considered.  An attempt has 
been made to compare recognition efficiencies for the
procedures defined.  For a few simple grammars 
and sentences a formal comparison has been made.  Empirical
comparison of the recognition of more realistic 
programming languages such as LISP and ALGOL has been
made by means of a program which simulates the 
Turing Machine on the Univac M-460 computer.  Several
algorithms for producing grammars equivalent to 
a given context-free grammar have been considered, and
the increase in recognition efficiency they afford 
has been empirically investigated.

Expanding the Editing Function In Language Data Processing

In automatic abstracting, citation indexing,
mechanical translation and other such procedures, 
editing is required whenever the automatic method leaves
something to be desired.  This paper discusses 
the economy of editing as a function of the amount of condensation
of text in language processing operations, 
and then contends that editing can be regarded as an
opportunity rather than as an unwelcome necessity. 
 "Heavy editing," which goes beyond mere correction
and improvement of computer output, is exemplified 
by the use of a concordance in preparing a survey article
or lecture.  Other opportunities for heavy 
editing are described, chief among them being interpretation and
expansion of computer output in such 
processes as factor analysis.  Applications are described,
such processes as factor analysis.  Applications 
are described, such as the quick, unbiased evaluation
of a large volume of incoming mail or telegrams, 
yielding summary reports not possible for either

This paper gives the considerations of Task
communication control philosophy.  The appearance of this
paper was forecast (underthe name of "second-level

upon solutions to the problems of transparency 
to the basic ASCII communication control characters

 Moreover, it goes on to cover the additional control problems
of handling material such as off line encrypted 
data or non-ASCII codes by means of systems providing
complete character transparency.  It does not cover 
concepts of transparency in which the normal character
structure or modulation rate of a system may be

Described in this paper is a divide-and-correct

correction of at most plus or minus one to the estimate,

Note on Triple-Precision Floating-Point Arithmetic with 132-Bit Numbers
.W
In a recent paper, Gregory and Raney described
a technique for double-precision floating-point 
arithmetic.  A similar technique can be developed for
triple-precision floating-point arithmetic and 
it is  the purpose of this note to describe this technique.
 Only the multiplication and the division 
algorithms are described, since the addition-subtraction
algorithm can be obtained by a trivial modification 
of the algorithm in Gregory's and Raney's paper.

PERT Time Calculations Without Topological Ordering
.W
A simplified technique is presented for PERT
Time calculations without topological ordering. 
 Each event is assigned a unique memory location.  An activity
is represented by a link.  A link is defined 
as a memory location containing the address of another
memory location.  The time information for an 
activity is carried with its link.  For a typical net,
the majority of activities can be described by 
one 36-bit cell each.  The remainder use two 36-bit
cells each.  The links are unidirectional; forward 
during the T(E) calculation (expected completion time for
an activity);backward during the T(L) calculation 
(time latest allowable for completion of an activity). 
The calculations progress through the net topologically 
even though the net is not represented topologically in core.

A Lightpen-Controlled Program For On-Line Data Analysis
.W
This paper describes a technique designed
to ease the use of a data processing system by a 
person, in particular, a scientist, who is intimately and
primarily concerned with interpreting the significance 
of data handled by the system.  Since such a person is
often unable to spend the time necessary to master 
a programming language, it is essential that he be aided
in composing commands to the computer.  In the 
system described, the user is not required to learn
or remember the vocabulary of the language because 
the vocabulary is displayed before him on"menus" by
means of a computer-drive scope.  He selects the 
various vocabulary elements required by pointing with
the light pen.  By use of a small unordered set 
of rewriting rules applied as a result of light pen
selections, the user generates only syntactically
correct commands to the system.  He does not have to learn
or remember the grammar.  The program restricts 
the user severely in the particular language he can use,
but the method for communicating with the program 
makes these restrictions seem quite natural and unconstraining.
 The program has been used successfully 
for over ten months.

A Mathematical Model for Mechanical part Description
.W
The flexibility of a mathematical model takes
advantage of the common information requirements 
of computer-aided engineering drawing, numerical control
tape generation, and physical characteristic 
computation.  By judicious control of man-machine communication
requirements, improved results over conventional 
engineering design processes are possible.  An English-like
input language, tailored for use by draftsmen 
and designers, will describe the part and specify the
output desired.  One approach to the mathematical 
model consists of a group of surface-defining quadric
equations, which are created by a system of modular 
subprogram.  Other subprograms will convert the mathematical
model into instructions for driving automatic 
drafting machines and numerical controlled machine tools.
 Physical part characteristics, such as center 
of gravity, can be computed by subprograms and used in
dynamic analysis work.  The proposed overall system 
is presented and experiments and demonstrations are discussed.

A Correspondence Between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-Notation: Part I*

This paper describes how some of the semantics
of ALGOL 60 can be formalized by establishing 
a correspondence between expressions of ALGOL 60 and expressions
into which ALGOL 60 is mapped.  Many of ALGOL 
60's features emerge as particular arrangements of
a small number of structural rules, suggesting new 
classifications and generalizations.  The correspondence
is first described informally, mainly by illustrations. 
 The second part of the paper gives a formal description,
i.e. an "abstract compiler" into the "abstract 
objct language."  This is itself presented in a "purely
functional" notation, that is one using only 
application and abstraction.

that the data-base question-answer has passed

questions for the advancement of general-purpose language

Use of Decision Tables in Computer Programming

A decision table is a tabular form for displaying

inherent advantages.  The technique to be illustrated
puts these advantages to use in that it enables 
one to program directly from a decision table.  The technique
is based on the creation of a binary image 
of a limited entry decision table in computer memory.
 A binary image of a given set of input conditions 
can also be created.  This data image is used to scan
the decision table image to arrive at the proper 
course of action.  There are several advantages gained
from the programming point view: (1) amount of 
computer memory used is drastically reduced, (2) programming
is simplified, and (3) documentation is 
brief and clear.

in which the best approximation can be very nearly
approached directly by a series development.  The

 This lag is attributed to four principal factors: (a)

The Augmented Predictive Analyzer for Context-Free

It has been proven by Greibach that for a given

as is generated by G and whose rules are all 
of the form Z --> cY(1) ... Y(m), (m >= O) where Z and
Y(i) are intermediate symbols and c a terminal 
symbol.  Since the predictive analyzer at Harvard uses
a standard-form grammar, it can accept the language 
of any context-free Grammar G, given an equivalent standard-form
grammar Gs.  The structural descriptions

originally due to Abbott is described standard-form 
grammar each of whose rules is in standard form, supplemented

derivation from the original context-free grammar. 
transformation effectively is also described.  In section

Conversion of Decision Tables to Computer
Programs by Rule Mark Techniques
.W
The rule mask technique is one method of converting
limited entry decision tables to computer 
programs.  Recent discussion suggest that in many circumstances
it is to be preferred to the technique 
of constructing networks or trees.  A drawback of the
technique as hitherto presented is its liability 
to produce object programs of longer run time than necessary.
 In this paper a modification of the technique 
is discussed which takes into account both rule frequencies
and the relative times for evaluating conditions. 
 This can materially improve object program run time.

Data Filtering Applied to Information Storage and Retrieval Applications
.W
Manipulation of data strings is the most complex
processing function in information storage 
and retrieval applications.  Data string manipulation
is discussed within the context of an interpretive 
processing environment controlled by the use of procedural
directives.  The sequence of procedural directives 
is derived from a job assumed to be expressed in a user-oriented
source language.  Each data string with 
the structured data environment (data bank) is explicitly
or implicitly related to a format declaration
residing in a format library.  The processing mechanics
associated with data string manipulation is developed 
in accordance with a generalized data filtering concept.
 This results in the implementation of a two-part 
data filter module that satisfies internal processing
functions by filtering data strings through format 
declarations associated with its input and output ports.

Code Extension in ASCII* (An ASA Tutorial)
.W
The American Standard Code for Information
Interchange (ASCII) contains a number of control 
characters associated with the principle of code extension,
that is, with the representation of information 
which cannot be directly represented by means of the characters
in the Code.  The manner of use of these 
characters has not previously been completely described.
 This paper presents a set of mutually consistent 
philosophies regarding code extension applications,
and suggests a corollary set of doctrines for the 
application of the code extension characters.  Distinctions
are drawn between code extension and such 
other concepts as "graphic substitution" or "syntactic
representation" which are often used to meet similar 
requirements.  Also covered are certain topics which
are not truly concerned with code extension but 
which are often linked with it in discussion on code applications.
 The material in this paper is equally 
applicable in principle to the (proposed) ISO international
7-bit code for information interchange.

Eliminating Monotonous Mathematics with FORMAC
.W
The FORMAC (FORmula MAnipulation Compiler)
programming system provides a powerful tool for 
performing mathematical analysis.  It is an extension
of FORTRAN IV which permits the use of the computer 
to perform the tedious algebraic computations that arise
in many different fields.  Among the areas in 
which it has been successfully used are: differentiation
of complicated expressions, expansion of truncated 
power series, solution of simultaneous equations with
literal coefficients, nonlinear maximum likelihood 
estimation, tensor analysis, and generation of the coefficients
of equations in Keplerian motion.  These 
types of analysis-which arose in the solution of specific
practical problems in physics, engineering, 
astronomy, statistics and astronautics-are discussed in
the paper.  In addition to its usage for specific 
problem solutions, FORMAC can also be used to automate
the analysis phase in certain production programming. 
 Several such applications are presented.

Computer Simulation-Discussion of the
.W
The purpose of this paper is to present a comparison
of some computer simulation languages 
and of some of the involved in comparing software packages
for digital computers are discussed in Part 
I.  The issue is obvious: users of digital computers
must choose from available languages or write their 
own.  Substantial costs can occur, particularly in training,
implementation and computer time if an inappropriate 
language is chosen.More and more computer simulation
languages are being developed: comparisons and 
evaluations of existing languages are useful for designers
and implementers as well as users.  The second 
part is devoted to computer simulation and simulation
languages.  The computational characteristics of 
simulation are discussed with  special attention being
paid to a distinction between continuous and discrete 
change models.  Part III presents a detailed comparison
of six simulation languages and packages: SIMSCRIPT, 
CLP, CSL, GASP, CPSS and SOL.  The characteristics of
each are summarized in a series of tables.  The 
implications of this analysis for designers of languages,
for users, and for implementers are developed. 
 The conclusion of the paper is that the packages now
available for computer simulation offer features 
which none of the more general-purpose packages do and
that analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each 
suggests ways in which both current and future simulation
languages and packages can be improved.

A Final Solution to the Dangling Else of ALGOL 60 and Related Languages
.W
The dangling else problem consists of a class
of potential ambiguities in ALGOL-like conditional 
statements whose basic form is "if B1 then if B2 then
S1 else S2" where B1 and B2 are Boolean expressions 
and S1 and S2 are basic statements.  The difficulty
lies in whether to attach the else to the first if 
or to the second one.  Existing solutions to the problem
are either ambiguous or unnecessarily restrictive. 
 Let Sand S1 be statements.  We define S to be closed
if "S else S1" is not a statement, and to be open 
if "S else S1" is a statement.  Thus an unconditional
statement is  a closed statement.  Open and closed 
conditional statements are defined by syntax equations
in such a way as to preserve openness and closure. 
 In each case, an else must always be preceded by a closed
statement.  It is shown that the syntax equations 
are unambiguous, and that may change in the statement
types required within the syntax equations would 
lead to either ambiguity or unnecessary restriction.

The use of computers to permit the widespread application
of mathematical ideas requiring computation 
in science and technology is extremely significant for
the understanding of our current society.  Student 
interest in this development is intense and if properly
utilized should yield a much better understanding 
of mathematical concepts as well as the ideas of programming
and logical structure which have been introduced 
into many fields by the use of computers.  The present
paper suggests that that portion of the undergraduate 
mathematical curriculum which is preparation for the use
of mathematics by persons who are not professional 
mathematicians be modified to include the extensions
and clarifications which are possible because of 
computers.  An early introduction to programming is
desirable to permit a continuing use of automatic 
computation to illustrate and clarify mathematical concepts.
 Following the calculus equation stage an 
intensive introduction to numerical analysis should
be added to the current curriculum.  In addition 
to providing competence in the mostly used computing
techniques, it would permit a more sophisticated 
utilization of the advanced mathematical ideas associated
with complex variables and transform theories.

itself, appears in appropriate, however, in the solution

may be prescribed, each being associated with 
a skeleton, so that a series of such pairs may be searched
until a pattern is found which matches an 
expression to be transformed.  The conditions for a match
are governed by a code which also allows subexpressions 
to be identified and eventually substituted into the
corresponding skeleton.  The primitive patterns 
and primitive skeletons are described, as well as the
principle which allow their elaboration in to more

language are that it allows one to apply transformation 
rules to lists and arrays as easily as strings, that both
patterns and skeletons may be defined recursively,

Computational Aspects of Multiple Covariance
Analysis on a Multifactor Structure
.W
The computational procedure for the analysis
of multiple covariance in statistics is discussed 
with reference to the analysis of variance.  A special
operator calculus developed by Hartly for programming 
analysis of variance for multifactor experiments is extended
to cover the analysis of covariance.  This 
extension is accomplished by utilizing the connection
between the analysis of covariance and the analysis 
of variance and by introducing a new operator.  The
results are illustrated by a numerical example for 
analysis of covariance, in which the basic computations
are shown to be carried out by an analysis-of-variance 
program.

The Eschenbach Drum Scheme
.W
The prime function of a drum, operating in
real time, is to perform accesses quickly.  The 
usual means for increasing this capacity is to incorporate
engineering or hardware improvements.  In 
this paper the problem is attacked not by changing the
drum, but rather by modifying the manner in which 
it operates.  At the outset, a drum is given a functional
definition.  Then a simple design scheme (Eschenbach) 
is introduced which enormously increases the rate of
accessing for drums so defined.  This is shown to 
enable a system to perform a job by employing fewer or
less expensive drums.  It is suggested that although 
the design scheme has a specific use, the method underlying it
has more general applicability.  The question 
of the efficacy of the drum scheme is then raised.  To
deal with this, a standard of efficiency is developed 
in light of realistic real-time circumstances.  The drum
scheme is then modelled in a manner which permits 
it to be analyzed as a problem in queueing theory. 
Thus one is enabled to ascertain whether the drum 
scheme is efficient enough for its application.  Again,
whereas the analysis of the drum scheme has a 
specific use, the methods underlying it have more general applicability.

Interarrival Statistics for Time Sharing Systems
.W
The optimization of time-shared system performance
requires the description of the stochastic 
processes governing the user inputs and the program activity.
 This paper provides a statistical description 
of the user input process in the SDC-ARPA general-purpose
Time-Sharing System (TSS).  The input process 
is assumed to be stationary, and to be defined by the
interarrival time distribution.  The data obtained 
appear to justify satisfactorily the common assumption
that the interarrival times are serially independent. 
 The data do not appear to justify, except as a very
rough approximation, the usual assumption off an 
exponential distribution for interarrival time.  A much
more satisfactory approximation to the data can 
be obtained with a biphase or triphase hyperexponential distribution.

Comparison of Several Algorithms for Computation
.W
Several algorithms for computation of basic
statistics are compared by their performance on 
systematically generated test data.  The statistics
calculated were the mean, standard deviation and 
correlation coefficient.  For each statistic, the algorithm
included the usual computing formulas, correction 
due to an accumulated error term, and a recursive computation
of the current value of the statistic. 
 The usual computing formulas were also evaluated in
double precision.  Large errors were noted for some 
calculation using the usual computing formulas.  The most
reliable technique was correction of the initial 
estimate by use of an accumulated error term.  To eliminate
the need for making two passes on the data, 
it was suggested that the initial estimate of the
mean be obtained from a subset of the data.

The Banking Information System Concept
.W
Most large commercial banks have progressed to
the  point where their major accounting applications 
have been automated and more sophisticated usage of
data processing equipment is being sought.  This, 
coupled with the availability of equipment well suited
to real-time, direct access processing,has led 
to development within some banks of the central file
of data base approach toward a banking information 
system.  The banking information system now serves the
two-fold purpose of providing real-time responses 
to inquires about individual account stasus and providing
more complex combinations of information for 
management use.  Both kinds of processing draw upon a
common store of data contained in the direct access 
central file.  This data base includes indexes which
facilitate cross referencing of account information 
so that all relationships between bank and customer may
be discerned.  In introducing the banking information 
system concept, a gradual approach to account cross-referencing
and file conversion is most prudent. 
 Generally, this system must interface with other computer
applications already existing within the bank.

Automatic Derivation of Microsentences
.W
The decomposition of long complex English sentences
into shorter kernel-like constituent sentences 
(microsentences)has often been suggested as an avenue
toward conducting automatic retrieval of natural 
language messages.  To explore the prospects of such
a step, the authors attempted in 1963 to prepare 
a general program for deriving microsentences from longer
sentences that had been syntactically analyzed 
by the Harvard Multipath Analysis Program.  The basic
idea was to extract the subject, verb and object 
(if any) of each clause and to reassemble these materials
into a grammatical microsentence.  A program 
is described in this paper, which was designed to operate
on the tree structure output of the analyzer, 
and the microsentences that were produced are exhibited.
 The authors conclude that while microsentences 
of the quality achieved do not open up immediate prospects
for improving the performance of automatic 
message retrieval systems, they may have practical
value in man-machine systems using human monitors 
to select the preferred syntactic interpretation of a sentence.

A Simple Algorithm for Computing the Generalized Inverse of a Matrix
.W
The generalized inverse of a matrix is important
in analysis because it provides an extension 
of the concept of an inverse which applies to all matrices.
 It also has many applications in numerical 
analysis, but it is not widely used because the existing
algorithms are fairly complicated and require 
considerable storage space.  A simple extension has
been found to the conventional orthogonalization 
method for inverting non-singular matrices, which gives
the generalized inverse with little extra effort 
and with no additional storage requirements.  The algorithm
gives the generalized inverse for any m by 
n matrix A, including the special case when m+n and A
is non-singular and the case when m>n and rank(A) 
= n.  In the first case the algorithm gives the ordinary
inverse of A.  In the second case the algorithm 
yields the ordinary least squares transformation matrix
INV(A'A)A' and has the advantage of avoiding 
the loss of significance which results in forming the product A'A explicitly.

Flow Diagrams, Turing Machines And

In the first part of the paper, flow diagrams
are introduced to represent inter al. mappings 
of a set into itself.  Although not every diagram is
decomposable into a finite number of given base 
diagrams, this becomes true at a semantical level due
to a suitable extension of the given set and of 
the basic mappings defined in it.  Two normalization
methods of flow diagrams are given.  The first has 
three base diagrams; the second, only two.  In the second
part of the paper, the second method is applied 
to the theory of Turing machines.  With every Turing
machine provided with a two-way half-tape, there 
is associated a similar machine, doing essentially
the same job, but working on a tape obtained from 
the first one by interspersing alternate blank squares.
 The new machine belongs to the family, elsewhere 
introduced, generated by composition and iteration from
the two machines L and R.  That family is a proper 
subfamily of the whole family of Turing machines.

A Note on Linear Programming Algorithm Design: A Combinatorial Problem
.W
As linear programming models grow bigger and
bigger in size, much actual data that must be 
memorized is often put on magnetic tape or disk, and
consequently there is an improportionality fast 
rise in the consumption of computer time.To cut down
this expense, an ever increasing effort is made 
to design more efficient algorithms.  This paper is
meant to support the effort.  It is attempted to 
find some characteristics of the way a pivot column
is found.  The number of repetitions of a certain 
transfer of data from tape to core memory is considered.
 After some simplification, the problem is restated 
in a general way.  The generating function of the probability
distribution and the moment generating 
function of the number of repetitions is found.  Asymptotic
formulas are given for the moments using 
a result from a paper of S. Narumi [1].  The results
may be applied to write very efficient routines 
that search for an extreme value in a table.  Formulas
provide a means of calculating the computer timings 
in this case.

for Programming Automatic Test Equipment
.W
For the nonprogrammer, difficulty in using
a language increases rapidly with the number of 
nonproblem-oriented conventions.  A simple language, even
if inelegant, which considers the user's background 
as part of the problem may be more effective than a source
language containing subtle and more powerful 
capabilities.  The language described in this paper is
used to write computer programs which test electronic 
equipment.  Because this testing process contains few
complex ideas, there is little need for the elegance 
and redundancy of a highly syntax-oriented language.
 A simple and direct language will suffice for the 
problem.  The eventual users of this language are military
depot personnel who cannot he expected to 
have computer programming skill or significant programming
training.  For this nonprogramming-oriented 
user, it was essential to create a language using familiar
engineering statements; programming-oriented 
conventions would have unnecessarily complicated his task.

TRAC, A Procedure-Describing Language for the Reactive Typewriter

 In the TRAC language, one can write procedures for
accepting, naming and storing any character string 
from the typewriter; for modifying any string in any way;
for treating any string at any time as an executable 
procedure, or as a name, or as text; and for printing
out any string.  The TRAC language is based upon 
an extension and generalization to character strings
of the programming concept of the "macro."  Through 
the ability of TRAC to accept and store definitions of
procedures, the capabilities of the language can 
be indefinitely extended, and can deal with character
strings, integers and Boolean vector variables.

Storage and Retrieval of Aspects of Meaning in Directed Graph Structures
.W
An experimental system that uses LISP to make
a conceptual dictionary is described.  The dictionary 
associates with each English word the syntactic information,
definitional material, and references to 
the contexts in which it has been used to define other words.
 Such relations as class inclusion, possession, 
and active or passive actions are used as definitional
material.  The resulting structure serves as a 
powerful vehicle for research on the logic of question answering.
 Examples of methods of inputting information 
and answering simple English questions are given.  An
important conclusion is that, although LISP and 
other list processing languages are ideally suited for
producing complex associative structures, they 
are inadequate vehicles for language processing on any
large scale-at east until they can use auxiliary 
memory as a continuous extension of core memory.

Multilevel Operating Systems
.W
The Basic software for all newer computers
is built on the well-established need for standard 
operating systems. This implies that all applications-no
matter how large, complex or time consuming-must 
operate under (or, more precisely, on top of) the standard
system.  Large applications require supervisory 
monitors which handle problems similar to those of
the operating systems, but at a different level.  
Sometimes, still a third or even a fourth such level
is required or desirable.  This leads naturally 
to the concept of multilevel systems-similar vertically,
but different horizontally.  Proper division 
of responsibility between levels leads to greater efficiency and
less logical complexity, while actually 
enhancing capability.

A family of unimplemented computing languages
is described that is intended to span differences 
of application area by a unified framework.  This framework
dictates the rules about the uses of user-coined 
names, and the conventions about characterizing functional
relationships.  Within this framework the 
design of a specific language splits into two independent
parts.  One is the choice of written appearances 
of programs (or more generally, their physical representation).
 The other is the choice of the abstract 
entities (such as numbers, character-strings, lists
of them, functional relations among them) that can 
be referred to in the language.  The system is biased
towards "expressions" rather than "statements." 
 It includes a nonprocedural(purely functional) subsystem
that aims to expand the class of users' needs 
that can be met by a single print-instruction, without sacrificing
the important properties that make 
conventional right-hand-side expressions easy to construct and understand.

The Structure of Programming Languages
.W
The following are identified as major components
of every programming language: (1) the elementary 
program statement, (2) mechanisms for linking elementary
statements together, (3) the means by which 
a program can obtain data inputs.  Several alternative
forms of each of these components are described, 
compared and evaluated.  Many examples, frequently from
list processing languages, illustrate the forms 
described.  Elementary program statements usually take
the form of commands, requirements, or implicit 
specifications.  A command is an imperative statement
that commands the action to be taken.  A requirement 
describes the effect to be achieved without saying anything
about the actions to be taken.  An implicit 
specification is similar to a requirement, but the programmer
must understand what actions will be taken 
to achieve the desired effect.  Subroutines may be entered
explicitly, by execute call, or by function 
composition.  Explicitly called subroutines generally
require special linkage conventions.  An execute 
subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from
a basic instruction of the programming language. 
 Function composition is a convenient alternative to
the explicit call.  The three principal ways of 
getting inputs for routines are (1) by referring to
the data itself, (2) by referring to the data by 
a "name", and (3) by referring to it implicitly by means

EULER: A Generalization ALGOL, and its Formal Definition: Part I*
.W
A method for defining programming languages is
developed which introduces a rigorous relationship 
between structure and meaning.  The structure of a
language is defined by a phrase structure syntax, 
the meaning in terms of the effects which the execution
of a sequence of interpretation rules exerts 
upon a fixed set of variables, called the Environment.
 There exists a one-to-one correspondence between 
syntactic rules and interpretation rules is determined by
the sequence of corresponding syntactic reductions 
which constitute a parse.  The individual interpretation
rules are explained in terms of an elementary 
an d obvious algorithmic notation.  A constructive
method for evaluating a text is provided, and for 
certain decidable classes of languages their unambiguity
is proved.  As an example, a generalization 
of ALGOL is described in full detail to demonstrate that
concepts like block-structure, procedures, parameters, 
etc. can be defined adequately and precisely by this method.

This paper presents an analysis on the normalization
requirement of the divisor in a divide-and-correct 
method.  This analysis is made subject to the condition
that not more than one correction is required 
to obtain the true quotient character, from the trial
estimate got from the division of a two-precision 
segment of every partial remainder by a suitably rounded
single-precision divisor.  (This segmented division 
is denoted here as a (2, 1) precision basic division.)
 It is found that the normalization requirement 
could be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors,
provided the magnitude of the character next to 
the leading character of the divisor is known.  If,
however, the normalization is to be eliminated one 
has to choose proper higher precision segments of operands
for the basic division.  Also considered is 
the possibility of eliminating the normalization by an
increase on the number of corrections on the quotient 
estimate got from a (2, 1) precision basic division.
 It is shown that such a scheme is economical only 
for small radices.

A SIMSCRIPT-FORTRAN Case Study
.W
Two programs for a vehicle dispatching model,
one written in 7040 SIMSCRIPT and the other in 
7040 FORTRAN IV are compared. The comparison is made
in terms of basic program design decisions, storage 
requirements, computer time used, and the ease of making
changes.  In the SIMSCRIPT program, the primary 
design considerations center around the choice of model
variables, model changing events, and model testing. 
 In the FORTRAN program, basic design problems relate
to the representation of the passage of time, the 
allocation of storage, and the organization of input
data.  The comparison of these differently designed 
programs shows that the SIMSCRIPT program uses more computer
storage and more computer time, but requires 
fewer program changes to introduce model revisions.

 Our algorithm is slower than an algorithm presented

but requires less storage.  For graphs with a large 
number of nodes and edges, when storage is limited our
algorithm is superior to Welch's; however, when

Welch's algorithm is superior.  Timing estimates

The LACONIQ (Laboratory Computer Online Inquiry)
Monitor was developed primarily to support 
non-numerical applications such as retrieval from very
large files by means of a "dialogue" between a 
system user and a retrieval application.  The monitor
was designed so that it could work with a small 
computer (an IBM System 360/30).  Therefore techniques
for resource allocation were important.  For this 
reason the use of core storage, computational facilities,
and input-output were all scheduled.  An unusual 
feature of the system is that it is event-driven rather
than clock-driven.  The program segments called 
into execution by the remote CRT consoles are invariably
run to completion rather than "rolled-out" to 
be brought back at a later time.

Methods for Analyzing Data from Computer Simulation Experiments
.W
This paper addresses itself to the problem of
analyzing data generated by computer simulations 
of economic systems.  We first turn to a hypothetical firm,
whose operation is represented by  single-channel, 
multistation queueing model.  The firm seeks to maximize
total expected profit for the coming period 
by selecting one of five operating plans, where each
plan incorporates a certain marketing strategy, 
an allocation of productive inputs, and a total cost.
 The results of the simulated activity under each 
plan are subjected to an F-test, two multiple comparison
methods, and a multiple ranking method.  We 
illustrate, compare, and evaluate these techniques.
 The paper adopts the position that the particular 
technique of analysis (possibly not any one of the above)
chosen by the experimenter should be an expression 
of his experimental objective: The F-test tests the homogeneity
of the plans; multiple comparison methods 
quantify their differences; and multiple ranking methods
directly identify the one best plan or best 
plans.

software, and its environment.  The measures of system performance
produced by the model consist of statistics

On Computing The Fast Fourier Transform
.W
Cooley and Tukey have proposed a fast algorithm
for computing complex Fourier transform and 
have shown major time savings in using it to compute
large transforms on a digital computer.  With n 
a power of two, computing time for this algorithm is
proportional to n log2 n, a major improvement over 
other methods with computing time proportional to n^2.
 In this paper, the fast Fourier transform algorithm 
is briefly reviewed and fast difference equation methods
for accurately computing the needed trigonometric 
function values are given.  The problem of computing
a large Fourier transform on a system with virtual 
memory is considered, and a solution is proposed.  This
method has been used to compute complex Fourier 
transforms of size n = 2^16 on a computer with 2^15
words of core storage; this exceeds by a factor of 
eight the maximum radix two transform size with fixed
allocation of this amount of core storage.  The 
method has also been used to compute large mixed radix
transforms.  A scaling plan for computing the 
fast Fourier transform with fixed-point arithmetic is also given.

A Grammar Base Question Answering Procedure
.W
The subject of this paper is a procedure for
the automatic retrieval of certain segments of 
stored information, either explicitly or implicitly represented,
through questions posed in natural language 
sentences.  This procedure makes use of a sentence recognition
device for the class of grammars which 
will correctly decide between the grammatical and ungrammatical
sentences of a natural language.  It 
is possible to make use of a recognition device of this
sort for the following reason: Much data is fully 
expressible as a set of sentences in a natural language,
a set which can be exhaustively and exclusively 
generated by a grammar.  Based upon the rules of this grammar,
a sentence recognizer will evaluate sentences, 
questions in the normal situation.  Since the recognition
function succeeds just in case the posed question 
is drawn from the set of sentences expressing the data,
or, more correctly, is grammatical in terms of 
the grammar for this set of sentences, sentence recognition
itself is a procedure for retrieving information. 
 When the recognition function succeeds, its
value represents the requested information.

An experimental processing system for the algorithmic
language EULER has been implemented in 
microprogramming on an IBM System/360 Model 30 using a

of a microprogrammed compiler and a microprogrammed
String Language Interpreter, and of an I/O control 
program written in 360 machine language.  The system is described
and results are given in terms of microprogram 
and main storage space required and compiler and interpreter

Computer Formulation of the Equations of Motion Using Tensor Notation
.W
A means is described for extending the area
of application of digital computers beyond the 
numerical data processing stage and reducing the need for
human participation in the formulation of certain 
types of computer problems.  By the use of tensor calculus
and a computer language designed to facilitate 
symbolic mathematical computation, a method has been
devised whereby a digital computer can be used to 
do non-numeric work, that is, symbolic algebraic manipulation
and differentiation. To illustrate the 
techniques involved, a digital computer has been used
to derive the equations of motion of a point mass 
in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system.
 Since this operation involves a formulation in 
terms of first- and second-order differential coefficients,
it provides a good demonstration of a computer's 
capability to do non-numeric work and to assist in the
formulation process which normally precedes the 
numerical data processing stage.  Moreover, this particular
problem serves to illustrate the advantages 
of the mathematical techniques employed.  With the program
prepared for this purpose the computer will 
derive the equations of motion in any coordinate system
requested by the user.   Results are presented 
for the following coordinate systems: cylindrical
polar, spherical polar, and prolate spheroidal.

time, keypunching time, debugging time, 
number of runs, and elapsed time from the first run
to the last run on each problem.  Even though the 
results are influenced by the fact that "bonus points"

in less than a specified number of runs, there

Description of Basic Algorithm in DETAB/65 Preprocessor

The basic algorithm for the conversion of decision
tables into COBOL code is contained in the
generator portion of the DETAB/65 preprocessor.  The
generator analyzes a decision table and produces 
simple COBOL conditional statements.  Core storage is
saved by using queueing techniques and extensive 
indexing and also by outputting the code as it is generated,
a line at a time.  The only optimization 
attempted is the elimination of obviously unnecessary
tests on certain conditions in the decision table. 
 Since the preprocessor and this language associated with
it were developed for COBOL users, the preprocessor 
was written in a modular form in required COBOL-61.

A Model for a Multifunctional Teaching System
.W
A teaching system model that was incorporated
into an operating system of a large computer 
is described.  The model transferred control to the
operating system to execute functions other than 
teaching, and then recovered control in order to resume
teaching.  The teaching system (ABAC-II) was 
written to run under the operating system (IBSYS) for
the IBM 7044 Graphic System.  Because the teaching 
system automatically terminated and rescheduled itself,
a student studying a course presented at a cathode-ray 
display terminal could switch readily between student
mode and programmer mode.  During the latter, the 
full resources of the operating system (language processors,
compilers, library and user's programs) 
were at his disposal.  He could for example, write, assemble,
debug, and execute at the terminal a program 
written in any language processed by the operating system.

String Similarity and Misspellings
.W
The problem of programming a computer to determine
whether or not a string of characters is 
a misspelling of a given word was considered.  A numberof
algorithms were evaluated-some proposed by 
other writers, some by the author.  These techniques
were tested on a collection of misspellings made 
by students at various grade levels.  While many of
the methods were clearly unsatisfactory, some gave 
as few as 2.1 percent incorrect determinations.

 With the new language, the user need only describe
his problem in "equation-like" form. The method

with the translation from equation form to computer 
instruction. In this way the POSE language user can
solve difficult computational problems (like the 
solution of differential equation) without requiring
a knowledge of numerical methods or the intricacies 
of computer subroutine logic. Essentially all clerical
operations now required for FORTRAN programming 
have been automated so that the POSE programmer

system by means of a statistically designed 
experiment.  An identical set of four programming problems
was assigned to each of a group of four programming 
subjects.  Influences external to the systems, such as
the sequence of problem solution, and programmer 
and problem characteristics, were specified as design
factors in the experiment.  Data was obtained for 
six variables (e.g., programmer time, computer time,
elapsed time, etc.) which were considered to be 
definitive of "system effectiveness," and analysis of
variance techniques were employed to estimate system 
differences in these variables after differences due to
the design factors had been eliminated.  Statistical 
analysis of the experimental results provided strong
evidence of important system differences, as well 
as a critique of the experimental design itself
with implications for further experimentation.

Numerical Integration of Function That Has a Pole
.W
It is common to need to integrate numerically
functions that diverge somewhere outside the 
range of integration.  Even if the divergence occurs quite
far away, integration formulas like Simpson's, 
that depend on fitting a polynomial, usually will be
inaccurate: near a pole they will be very bad.  
A method is described that gives formulas that will integrate
functions of this kind accurately if the 
orders and positions of the poles are known.  Explicit
formulas are given that are easy to use on an 
automatic computer.  It is shown that they can be used
for some other singularities as well as poles. 
 If the integral converges, integration can be carried
to the singularity.  The accuracy of the integration 
with a pole of second order is discussed, and, as an example,
the new formula is compared with Simpson's. 
 The new formulas are useful even far from the pole,
while near the pole their advantage is overwhelming.

an examination schedule which requires a minimum number
of examination periods and satisfies the constraint 
that no student be required to take two examinations
simultaneously can be found in two steps.  First, 
course which may have their examinations scheduled at
the same period are grouped together in all possible 
ways.  Then a minimum number of these groups, such that
each course is included at least once, are selected. 
 By removing multiple occurrences of courses and then scheduling
each group at a different period a minimal 
 Approximations to the ideal procedure outlined above are
given which yield nonminimal but feasible schedules 
with a very small expenditure of time.  Results of experiments
using these techniques are given.  These 
are encouraging and indicate that further experimentation would be worthwhile.

One-Pass Compilation of Arithmetic Expressions for a Parallel Processor
.W

 Most of the presently known compilation techniques
are inadequate for such a processor because they 
produce expression structures that must be evaluated serially.
 A technique is presented here for compiling 
arithmetic expressions into structures that can be

Sorting by Replacement Selecting
.W
In sorting by replacement selecting, the expected
length of a sequence beginning with the i-th 
element (i>1) is proved to be 2F, in accordance with
a conjecture of E. H. Friend, where F is the number 
of memory cells used.  The expected length of the j-th
sequence is determined to be F times a j-th degree 
polynomial in e, such that the value of this polynomial
approaches 2 as j approaches infinity.  Recursive 
formulas are obtained for both the mean and the standard
deviation of the length of the j-th sequence. 
 The mathematical proofs of these results are based
upon the assumption that n, the number of items to 
be sorted, is infinite, but it is shown that the error
due to the finiteness of n approaches zero rapidly 
as n increases.

A Use of Fast and Slow Memories in List-Processing Languages
.W
A scheme is described which permitting a substantial
increase in memory space utilized to store 
list-structured data.  It consists in reducing to one
level a nonhomogeneous store composed of fast (core) 
and slow (disk or drum) memories.  The space available
in slow memory is divided into pages each containing 
a given number of machine words.  The reduction to a
one-level memory is performed by a program which 
leaves the most often called pages in the fast memory.
 When a new page from slow store is requested, 
the page in core having the longest period of inactivity
is transferred back to the slow store.  The 
complete scheme has been implemented in connection with
a LISP embedding into ALGOL, using an IBM 7044 
with 32k of core memory and disks.  Gains in memory space
were about 100-fold.  As often happens in programming 
applications the price of the additional space is computer
time.  Although the disks have an access time 
10^4 times slower than core, tests indicate that the
actual slow down varied from 3 to 10, depending 
on the number of pages available in the fast store.

WATFOR is an in-core, load-and-go compiler
which has been implemented within the IBM 7040/44 
operating system.  FORTRAN IV was selected as the source
language in order to achieve maximum language 
compatibility with other available compiling systems,
in particular the IBM 7040/44 FORTRAN IV system. 
 The principal advantage of the WATFOR compiler is that
it translates FORTRAN IV programs at speeds of 
up to 100 statements per second.  Since the compiler
resides core there is virtually no system overhead, 
and hence large batches of "student" programs may be processed very
efficiently.  The compiler also provides 
extensive error diagnostics, during both the compilation
and the execution phases of a program run.  
This feature makes the system attractive to
both learners and learned users alike.

A computational method which may be used for

of variance of complete factorial experiments and in
the computation of main effect or interaction means 
is described.  The method is elucidated as unifying since
one method can be used for a variety of purposes 
each previously requiring different methods.  The programming
advantages of such a method are obvious. 
 The following variants are discussed: (1) the standard
analysis of variance; (2) analyses omitting certain 
levels of one or more factors; (3) separate analyses
for some levels of a factor or for combinations 
of levels of more than one factor.  These are performed
simultaneously; (4) the calculation of main effect 
or interaction means.  The mean expects the data in standard
order and it leaves the data in that order 
so that many analyses of the same data can be performed
without rearrangement.  The total sum of squares, 
excluding a replication sum of squares, is partitioned
into all polynomial partitions and their interactions 
each with one degree of freedom.  This is so even
if factors have unequally spaced factor levels.

An Interpretive Input Routine for Linear Programming

In this descriptive article an input code
is presented which greatly simplifies data input 
to any linear programming solution routine, for subsequent
use either as a pedagogical device or for 
solving rather small LP problems.  This latter (limited)
use derives not at all from inherent limitations 
in the code itself, but from an efficiency evaluation:
large LP problems would doubtless benefit from 
an input system more suited for bulk data handling than
the input code described.  From a user's standpoint, 
input appears almost exactly as a textbook presentation
of the LP problem (limited only by a keypunch's 
inability to write subscripts, etc.).  The input interpreter
scans column wise, thus no fixed format 
data preparation is required.  The user may also, under
very general requirements only, liberally use 
editorial comments throughout the input deck as an
aid in identification, e.g., of row constraints.  
The article includes examples of input, output from a
solution routine presently in use, and a skeleton

Automatic Generation of Efficient Lexical
Processors Using Finite State Techniques
.W
The practical application of the theory of
finite-state automata to automatically generate 
lexical processors is dealt with in this tutorial article
by the use of the AED RWORD system, developed 
at M.I.T. as part of the AED-1 system.  This system
accepts as input description of the multicharacter 
items or of words allowable in a language given in terms
of a subset of regular expressions. The output 
of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string
of characters and combines them into the items 
as defined by the regular expressions.  Each output
item is identified by a code number together with 
a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters
and character count in the item.  The processors 
produced by the system are based on finite-state machines.
 Each state of a "machine" corresponds to 
a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character
string.  At each state a character is read, 
and the machine changes to a new state.  At each transition
appropriate actions are taken based on the 
particular character read.  The system has been in operation
since 1966, and processors generated have 
compared favorably in speed to carefully hand-coded programs
to accomplish the same task.  Lexical processors 
for AED-O and MAD are among the many which have been
produced.  The techniques employed are independent 
of the nature of the items being evaluated.  If the
word "events" is substituted for character string, 
these processors may be described as generalized decision-making
mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence 
of events.  This allows the system to be used in a
range of applications outside the area of lexical 
processing.  However convenient these advantages may
be, speed is the most important consideration.  
In designing a system for automatic generation of a
lexical processor, the goal was a processor which 
completely eliminated backup or rereading, which was nearly
as fast as hand-coded processors, which would 
analyze the language and detect errors, and
which would be convenient and easy to use.

Easy English,a Language for Information
Retrieval Through a Remote Typewriter Console
.W
Easy English is a natural command language
designed to simplify communication between man and 
machine through remote typewriter console.  It has been developed
for retrieval of documents from a computerized 
data base, the Moore School Information Systems Laboratory
files.  Requests are formulated in a standardized 
syntactical form (examples of which are presented), and
this form is then transformed into an equivalent 
query expressed in the retrieval system's original Symbolic
Command Language, which is briefly described. 
 Operation of easy English is detailed by illustration
of the transformations performed upon a sample 
request up to the point at which the request string
is sent to the system.  A macro flowchart of Easy 
English is included, and an Appendix provides
the printout of a retrieval demonstration.

Ambiguity in Limited Entry Decision Tables
.W
The use of decision tables as a tool in systems
analysis and for program specification is now 
becoming accepted.  Rules on redundancy, contradiction,
and completeness for limited entry tables were 
published in 1963.  These are usually used for checking,
preceded if necessary by a conversion from extended 
to limited entry form.  Processors which automatically
translate tables to more conventional program 
usually base their diagnostic facilities on these rules.
 In this paper it is suggested that these rules 
are unsatisfactory and that the important aspect of
checking is to eliminate ambiguity from tables.  
Ambiguity is defined and discussed, and a procedure for
producing checked-out decision tables is proposed. 
 The theoretical basis of the algorithm used is established.
The importance of well-designed diagnostic 
facilities in decision table processors is emphasized.

A Comparison of the Correlational Behavior
of Random Number Generators for the IBM 360
.W
Hutchinson states that the "new" (prime modulo)
multiplicative congruential pseudorandom generator, 
attributed to D. H. Lehmer, has passed the usual statistical
tests for random number generators.  It 
is here empirically shown that generators of this type
can produce sequences whose autocorrelation functions 
up to lag 50 exhibit evidence of nonrandomness for many
multiplicative constants.  An alternative generator 
proposed by Tausworthe, which uses irreducible polynomials
over the field of characteristic two, is shown 
to be free from this defect.  The applicability of these
two generators to the IBM 360 is then discussed. 
 Since computer word size can affect a generator's statistical
behavior the older mixed and simple congruential 
generators, although extensively tested on computers
having 36 or more bits per word, may not be optimum 
generators for the IBM 360.

PEEKABIT, Computer Offspring of Punched

The "peekaboo" idea from punched card information
retrieval methods has been mated with the 
idea of superimposed punching to produce a programming
technique which cuts computer run time in half 
on a test search of 33,000 subject index entries.  A search
program using the device has been operational 
since late 1963.  As an item is entered in the store,
an 18-byte mask is created from the item's meaningful 
words using the inclusive OR operation.  If, at search
time, the logical product (using the AND operation) 
of this mask and a similarly constructed question mask
is not equal to the question mask, then one or 
more question words are not present in the store item.
 An equality is in conclusive; the words of the 
store item must be unpacked and compared with question
words.  The present store is made up of over 600,000 
subject index entries estimated to average 60 characters
each.  Longer texts, such as abstracts, could 
be handled by multiple masks.

Accommodating Standards and Identification of Programming Languages

The user public wants standardization and
reliable identification of programming languages

illustrated by the methods adopted for TRAC T-64 
interactive language, and its related family of languages.
 Oppressive rigidity usually associated with 
standardization is avoided by a new accommodation technique
accessible to the user to allow local variations 
with the language.  Explicit standardization of the language
is undertaken at the organizational source 
of the language.  Use of the organizational trademark
(TRAC) on the published standards, and services 
relying upon them, provides a reliable public identification.
 These methods can be usefully applied

written as a derived procedure; it outputs using 
the fixed point or the floating point representation,
and rounds properly.  Variants can easily be written 
because of the explicit call of the procedures decompose
integer and decompose real.  The highly recommended 
practice of echoing input is made easy with one subset
of derived procedures (ioi, ior, iob, ioa).  The 
documentation of output in the form of equivalent ALGOL
statements is also provided when use is made 
of the subset oti, otr, otb, ota.  The Berkeley style
of providing information on the form of output 
using prior calls of procedures such as real format is
defined.  A use of the parameter outchannel to 
provide information for simultaneous output to several
channels is suggested.  Interrelationship between 
the declared procedures is furnished in tabular form.

Methods of Convergence Improvement for Some Improper Integrals

The efficiency of such integration schemes can often

integrals, e.g. integrals whose integrands 
are rational polynomials, these transformations fail
to yield much improvement.  In this paper, several

An efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by Lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  Thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  The use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  Lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (Thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  In this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented.

Preliminary Investigation of Techniques
for Automated Reading of Unformatted Text
.W
Methods for converting unstructured printed
material into computer code are experimentally 
investigated.  An operator-controlled mode, depending
on human demarcation of the various regions of 
the page for guiding the scanner, is implemented by
means of a joystick and a CRT display.  This mode, 
for which some performance figures are obtained, is thought
to be suitable for processing very complicated 
material, such as technical journals.  For simpler material,
for instance the "claims" sections of patents, 
and in applications where the utmost accuracy is not necessary,
an unsupervised mode is advocated.  Here, 
the textual portions of the page are located during
a rapid prescan by a rudimentary form of frequency 
analysis.  These areas are then rescanned at a higher
resolution suitable for character recognition. 
 Error rates of the order of 0.1 percent are obtained in
a simple problem involving photographs of telephone 
company meter boards.  Other matters related to the
design of a general purpose page reader, such as 
the segmentation of printed text, the possibility of
time-sharing the scanner, interactive man-machine 
operation, and the facsimile reproduction of illustrations, are discussed.

One Way of Estimating Frequencies of Jumps in a Program
.W
For the segmentation of a program it is useful
to have a reasonable estimation of the values 
of S(ij), where S(ij) is the mean value of the number
of jumps from the i-th instruction on to the j-th 
instruction in the run time.  In the cases where the
S(ij) are estimated directly, the structure of the 
whole program must be generally taken into account;
therefore it is very difficult for the programmer 
and/or the translator to obtain a good estimation of
the S(ij).  It is easier to estimate not S(ij) but 
i.  Although the P(ij) are, for each i, proportional to
S(ij), the estimation of P(ij) is easier, because 
we must estimate only the "probabilities" of events
where instruction i is executed after instruction 
I(i).  This estimation can often be done without considering
the structure of the whole program.  In 
the first part of the paper, using the theory of the
Markov chains, an algorithm for the computation 
of the S(ij) from the P(ij) is found, and some ways
of obtaining estimates of the P(ij) are given.  In 
the second part a variant of this algorithm is derived,
avoiding the necessity of computation involving 
large matrices.

Further Experimental Data on the Behavior
of Programs in a Paging Environment
.W
Results are summarized from an empirical study
directed at the measurement of program operating 
behavior in those multiprogramming systems in which
programs are organized into fixed length pages.  
The data collected from the interpretive execution of
a number of paged programs are used to describe 
the frequency of page faults, i.e. the frequency of those
instants at which an executing program requires 
a page of data or instructions not in main (core) memory.
 These data are used also for the evaluation 
of page replacement algorithms and for assessing the
effects on performance of changes in the amount 
of storage allocated to executing programs.

BRAD: The Brookhaven Raster Display
.W
A multiconsole computer display system has
been designed that provides very rich displays at 
low unit cost.  Each BRAD (Brookhaven Raster Display)
console can plot tens of thousands of points, or 
up to 4000 characters at 30 frames per second.  After
an initial display system investment of $50,000 
each display, with teletype, costs less than $3,000.
 The technique employed is that of programmatically 
generating a binary image of the desired display in a
computer.  The image is written on a rotating drum 
memory.  Independent read heads continuously display
the picture, which is generated by swept horizontal 
lines.  A standard TV monitor serves as the display device.
 The technique has two drawbacks.  A computer 
must compute any image to be displayed.  Also, the "pointing"
interaction is more difficult.  This is 
because the pointing function gives only the coordinates
of the point on the screen.  The inverse of 
the map generation process is required to calculate
the coordinates of the point on the screen.  The 
inverse of the map generation process is required to
calculate the coordinates at the selected point 
in the input space.

 As it was found that successive improvements to 
the display processor design lie on a circular path, by
making improvements one can return to the original 
simple design plus one new general purpose computer for
each trip around.  The degree of physical separation 
between display and parent computer is a key factor in display processor design.

The designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  Three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  These criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  To define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  Examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.

"working set model," is developed. The working set
of pages associated with a process, defined to be 
the collection of its most recently used pages, provides
knowledge vital to the dynamic management of 
paged memories.  "Process" and "working set" are shown to
be manifestations of the same ongoing computational 
activity; then "processor demand" and "memory demand"
are defined; and resource allocation is formulated 
as the problem of balancing demands against available equipment.

All published error coefficients for estimating

computed on the assumption that the quadrature rule
was exact for polynomials up to a given degree.  
Since these rules use rounded values for the abscissas and
weights and since the true values of the integrals 
of some of the polynomials in question have an infinite
binary expression, the quadrature rule is not 
exact.  Hence these errors must be taken into consideration
in computing practical error coefficients.

Toward a General Processor for Programming Languages

Many efforts have been made to develop a better

language than by the construction of a whole new compiler,
but so far none has proved generally satisfactory. 
 In this paper, it is contended that a programming
language is best described functionally as a body 
of macro instructions, and that the macro call constitutes
a canonical form in terms of which a programming 
notation may be described.  A supporting discussion of the
logical and his torical role of the macro instruction 
is presented.  Also discussed are the conflict between
machine independence and object program efficiency, 
and the question of where the greatest difficulties
lie in compiler construction.

in Developing an Analytic Prediction Method
.W
Multiprogramming as it is discussed here is
a mode of computer operation in which two or more
programs are concurrently in processor memory and proceeding,
each using the same central processor unit 
(CPU) and input-output (I/O) channels.  These programs
are actually proceeding intermittently and singly, 
according to eligibility (readiness to proceed) and priority.
 It is useful to be able to represent them 
as proceeding continuously and simultaneously, each
at an effective rate, which may be a fraction of 
that which it would enjoy in the absence of the other
programs.  The effective progress rate of each 
program is sensitive to many detailed characteristics
of itself and its co-residents and simulation has 
been the best available method of predicting it.  This
paper presents the results of progress in developing 
an alternative to simulation, a simulation-tested iterative
computation of these rates under certain 
situations.  The algorithm is sensitive to most of the
factors that control the phenomenon, including 
nonquantitative or topological features of the programs' structures.

On the Downhill Method

The downhill method is a numerical method for
solving complex equations f(z) = 0 on which the 
only restriction is that the function w = f(z) must
be analytical.  An introduction to this method is 
given and a critical review of relating literature is
presented.  Although in theory the method always 
converges, it is shown that a fundamental dilemma exists
which may cause a breakdown in practical applications. 
 To avoid this difficulty and to improve the rate of
convergence toward a root, some modifications of 
the original method are proposed and a program (FORTRAN)
based on the modified method is given in Algorithm 
365.  Some numerical examples are included.

Optimization of Expressions in Fortran
.W
A method of optimizing the computation of
arithmetic and indexing expressions of a Fortran 
program is presented.  The method is based on a linear
analysis of the definition points of the variables 
and the branching and DO loop structure of the program.
 The objectives of the processing are (1) to 
eliminate redundant calculations when references are
made to common subexpression values, (2) to remove 
invariant calculations from DO loops, (3) to efficiently
compute subscripts containing DO iteration variables, 
and (4) to provide efficient index register usage.  The
method presented requires at least a three-pass 
compiler, the second of which is scanned backward.  It
has been used in the development of several FORTRAN 
compilers that have proved to produce excellent object
code without significantly reducing the compilation 
speed.

Is Automatic "Folding" of Programs Efficient Enough To Displace Manual?

The operation of "folding" a program into
the available memory is discussed.  Measurements 
by Brown et al. and by Nelson on an automatic folding
mechanism of simple design, a demand paging unit 
built at the IBM Research Center by Belady, Nelson,
interface with a very large speed difference.  The disadvantages
of prefolding, which is required when 
the folding is manual, are examined, and a number of
the important troubles which beset computing today 
are shown to arise from, or be aggravated by, this
source.  It is concluded that a folding mechanism 
will probably become a normal part of most computing systems.

An affirmative partial answer is provided to
the question of whether it is possible to program 
parallel-processor computing systems to efficiently decrease
execution time for useful problems.  Parallel-processor 
systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of
the processors can simultaneously execute separate 
tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease
the solution time of a computational problem. The 
processors have independent instruction counters, meaning
that each processor executes its own task program 
means of data in storage shared by all processors.  A
program for the determination of the distribution 
of current in an electrical network was written for a
parallel-processor computing system, and execution 
of this program was simulated.  The data gathered from

APAREL is described: this language is an extension
to an algorithmic language (PL/I) that provides 
the pattern-matching capabilities normally found only
in special purpose languages such as SNOBOL4 and 
TMG.  This capability is provided through parse-requests
stated in a BNF-like format.  These parse-requests 
form their own programming language with special sequencing
rules.  Upon successfully completing a parse-request, 
an associated piece of PL/I code is executed.  This
code has available for use, as normal PL/I strings 
the various pieces (at all levels) of the parse.  It
also has available as normal PL/I variables, the
information concerning which of the various alternatives
semantic checks are also included.  APAREL has proven convenient
 in building a powerful SYNTAX and FUNCTION 
macro system, an algebraic language preprocessor debugging
system, an on-line command parser, a translator 
for Dataless Programming, and as a general string manipulator.

An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming
.W
In this paper an attempt is made to explore
the logical foundations of computer programming 
by use of techniques which were first applied in the
study of geometry and have later been extended to 
other branches of mathematics.  This involves the elucidation
of sets of axioms and rules of inference 
which can be used in proofs of the properties of computer
programs.  Examples are given of such axioms 
and rules, and a formal proof of a simple theorem is
displayed.  Finally, it is argued that important 
advantages, both theoretical and practical, may
follow from a pursuance of these topics.

functions when given the precedence matrix; this algorithm

An alternative approach to the design and organization
of a general purpose interactive multiterminal 
computing system is presented.  The system organization described
is a conceptually simple arrangement 
of a bank of interchangeable computers, each of which
is a memory/processor pair, that are assigned to 
process terminal jobs as they arrive.  One of the computers
serves as the master or control computer 
and supervises the collection and distribution of messages
from and to the remote terminals.  In the 
simplest form there is a disk drive for each connected
terminal.  A crosspoint switching network allows 
any such disk drive to be connected to any computer.
 Thus, while each active terminal user "occupies" 
a dedicated disk drive, he may share the computer with
many other terminal users in a simple manner. 
 The ratio of users to computers is dependent on both
the size and power of the machines used and the 
computation requirements of the particular mix of users.
 This system organization is inherently a simpler 
and therefore more reliable approach to time-sharing computers
and has the potential of a highly available 
system at relatively low cost.  Economic configurations
are possible for a range of systems sizes that 
span at least one order of magnitude.  Finally, problem
programs developed by remote terminal users can 
be run on a dedicated batch system if compatible computers are used.

Loader Standardization for Overlay Programs

first three systems is based on actual experience 
with a large overlaid trajectory simulation program;
a short history and description of this program 
is presented.  A standardization of minimum capabilities
for loaders is recommended so that programs 
which must operate under more than one computer system
may be easily converted and maintained.  A proposal 
that overlay software incorporates a memory occupation
specification concept instead of the conditional 
tree structure is delineated.  This concept provides
more efficient and cost-effective utilization of 
the memory as well as increased flexibility in program structure.

in Which Simultaneous Events May Occur
.W
Some of the problems of simulating discrete
event systems, particularly computer systems, on 
a conventional digital computer are dealt with.  The
systems are assumed to be described as a network 
of interconnected sequential processes.  Briefly reviewed
are the common techniques used to handle such 
simulations when simultaneous events do not occur, can
be ignored, or can be handled by simple priority 
rules.  Following this, the problem of dealing with simultaneous
events in separate processes is introduced. 
 An abstraction of this problem is developed which admits
solution for a majority of commonly encountered
problems.  The technique will either find a method of
simulating the parallel events or report that none 
can be found.  In some of the latter cases it is shown
to be possible to find a solution by extending 
the information available to the solution technique, but
in many cases the technique becomes computationally 
unfeasible when the additional information is provided.

An Algorithm for Finding a Fundamental Set of Cycles of a Graph
.W
A fast method is presented for finding a fundamental
set of cycles for an undirected finite 
graph.  A spanning tree is grown and the vertices examined
in turn, unexamined vertices being stored 
in a pushdown list to await examination.  One stage
in the process is to take the top element v of the 
pushdown list and examine it, i.e. inspect all those
edges (v,z) of the graph for which z has not yet 
been examined.  If z is already in the tree, a fundamental
cycle is added; if not, the edge (v,z) is 
placed in the tree.  There is exactly one such stage
for each of the n vertices of the graph.  For large 
n, the store required in creases as n^2 and the time as
n^g where g depends on the type of graph involved. 
 g is bounded below by 2 and above by 3, and it is shown
that both bounds are attained.  In terms of 
storage our algorithm is similar to that of Gotlieb and
Corneil and superior to that of Welch; in terms 
of speed it is similar to that of Welch and superior
to that of Gotlieb and Corneil.  Testsshow our 
algorithm to be remarkably efficient (g=2) on random graphs.

Compact List Representation: Definition,
Garbage Collection, and System Implementation
.W
Compact lists are stored sequentially in memory,
rather than chained with pointers.  Since 
this is not always convenient, the Swym system permits
a list to be chained, compact, or any combination 
of the two.  A description is given of that list representation
and the operators implemented (most are 
similar to those of LISP 1.5).  The system garbage collector
attempts to make all lists compact; it relocates 
and rearranges all of list storage using temporary storage.
 This unique list-compacting garbage collection 
algorithm is presented in detail.  Several classes of the
macros used to implement the system are described. 
 Finally, consideration is given to those design factors
essential to the success of a plex processing 
system implementation.

that it therefore may heavily contribute to the

of the interrupt and permits the specification of concurrent
(or pseudoconcurrent) activities in a supposedly 
more perspicuous manner.  It is intended to serve as
a basis for the construction of operating systems, 
which are prime examples of programs with concurrent
activities.  The scheme includes a set of basic 
instructions for the generation, termination, and synchronization
of parallel processes.  A set of routines 
representing these instructions and thereby simulating a
hypothetical machine organization has been implemented

 Techniques for keeping the size of the analysis 
record within reasonable limits and for avoiding the need

The Teachable Language Comprehender: 
A Simulation Program and Theory of Language
.W
The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is
a program designed to be capable of being taught 
to "comprehend" English text.  When text which the program
has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends 
that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit)
assertion of the new text to a large memory. 
 This memory is a "semantic network" representing factual
assertions about the world.  The program also 
creates copies of the parts of its memory which have
been found to relate to the new text, adapting and 
combining these copies to represent the meaning of the
new text.  By this means, the meaning of all text 
the program successfully comprehends is encoded into
the same format as that of the memory.  In this 
form it can be added into the memory.  Both factual
assertions for the memory and the capabilities for 
correctly relating text to the memory's prior content
are to be taught to the program as they are needed. 
 TLC presently contains a relatively small number of
examples of such assertions and capabilities, but 
within the system, notations for expressing either of these
are provided.  Thus the program now corresponds 
to a general process for comprehending language, and
it provides a methodology for adding the additional 
information this process requires to actually comprehend
text of any particular kind.  The memory structure 
and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions
and capabilities for relating text to such 
stored assertions to generalize automatically.  That
is, once such an assertion or capability is put 
into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend
a great many other sentences in the future. 
 Thus the addition of a single factual assertion or
linguistic capability will often provide a large 
increment in TLC's effective knowledge of the world and
in its overall ability to comprehend text.  The 
program's strategy is presented as a general theory of language comprehension.

resulting in two desirable consequences: 
(1) naming constraints disappear even when there is
indirect addressing within function definitions; 
and (2) there is a significant saving in the number of
calls to the garbage collector, because some garbage 
is collected, at little expense, each time a function
returns to its calling program.  These modifications 
have been implemented as an extension to a SNOBOL dialect.

Prevention of System Deadlocks

A well-known problem in the design of operating
systems is the selection of a resource allocation 
policy that will prevent deadlock.  Deadlock is the
situation in which resources have been allocated 
to various tasks in such a way that none of the tasks
can continue.  The various published solutions 
have been somewhat restrictive: either they do not handle
the problem in sufficient generality or they 
suggest policies which will on occasion refuse a request
which could have been safely granted.  Algorithms 
are presented which examine a request in the light of
the current allocation of resources and determine 
whether or not the granting of the request will introduce
the possibility of a deadlock.  Proofs given 
in the appendixes show that the conditions imposed by
the algorithms are both necessary and sufficient 
to prevent deadlock.  The algorithms have been successfully used in the THE system.

Recovery of Reentrant List Structures in SLIP
.W
One consequence of the reference-count-based
space-recovery system employed by SLIP is that 
reentrant list structures are not recovered even when
explicitly erased.  LISP-like garbage-collection 
schemes are free of this impediment.  They however,
depend on being able to find and mark nodes that 
are reachable from program variables.  By tracing all
descendants from program variables may then be 
identified and collected.  The list-creating function
LIST of SLIP may be amended to mark those lists 
for which the programmer wishes to assume responsibility.
 Given this modification, a LISP-like garbage 
collector that recovers abandoned reentrant list structures
may then be appended to the SLIP system.

The main purpose of this paper is the presentation
of some of the results of a series of simulation 
experiments investigating the phenomenon of storage fragmentation.
 Two different types of storage fragmentation 
are distinguished: (1) external fragmentation, namely the
loss in storage utilization caused by the inability 
to make use of all available storage after it has been
fragmented into a large number of separate blocks; 
and (2) internal fragmentation, the loss of utilization
caused by rounding up a request for storage, 
rather than allocating only the exact number of words required.
 The most striking result is the apparently 
general rule that rounding up requests for storage,
to reduce the number of different sizes of blocks 
coexisting in storage, causes more loss of storage
by increased internal fragmentation than is saved 
by decreased external fragmentation.  Described also are
a method of segment allocation and an accompanying 
technique for segment addressing which take advantage
of the above result.  Evidence is presented of 
possible advantages of the method over conventional paging techniques.

An Anomaly in Space-Time Characteristics of
Certain Programs Running in a Paging Machine
.W
The running time of programs in a paging machine
generally increases as the store in which 
programs are constrained to run decreases.  Experiments,
however, have revealed cases in which the reverse 
is true: a decrease in the size of the store is accompanied
by a decrease in running time.  An informal 
discussion of the anomalous behavior is given, and for
the case of the FIFO replacement algorithm a formal 
treatment is presented.

A Computer System for Transformational Grammar
.W
A comprehensive system for transformational
grammar has been designed and implemented on the 
IBM 360/67 computer.  The system deals with the transformational
model of syntax, along the lines of 
Chomsky's Aspects of the Theory of Syntax. The major
innovations include a full,formal description of 
the syntax of a transformational grammar, a directed random
phrase structure generator, a lexical insertion 
algorithm, an extended definition of analysis, and
a simple problem-oriented programming language in 
which the algorithm for application of transformations
can be expressed.  In this paper we present the 
system as a whole, first discussing the general attitudes underlying
the development of the system, then 
outlining the system and discussing its more important
special features.  References are given to papers 
which consider some particular aspect of the system in detail.

Given a set of expressions which are to be
compiled, methods are presented for increasing the 
efficiency of the object code produced by first factoring
the expressions, i.e. finding a set of subexpressions 
each of which occurs in two or more other expressions
or subexpressions.  Once all the factors have been 
ascertained, a sequencing procedure is applied which
orders the factors and expressions such that all 
information is computed in the correct sequence and factors
need be retained in memory a minimal amount 
of time.  An assignment algorithm is then executed in
order to minimize the total number of temporary 
storage cells required to hold the results of evaluating
the factors.  In order to make these techniques 
computationally feasible, heuristic procedures are
applied, and hence global optimal results are not 
necessarily generated.  The factorization algorithms
are also applicable to the problem of factoring 
Boolean switching expressions and of factoring polynomials
encountered in symbol manipulating systems.

Spline Function Methods for Nonlinear Boundary-Value Problems

The solution of the nonlinear differential equation
Y"=F(x,Y,Y') with two-point boundary conditions 
is approximated by a quintic or cubic spline function
y(x).  The method is well suited to nonuniform 
mesh size and dynamic mesh size allocation.  For uniform
mesh size h, the error in the quintic spline 
y(x) is O(h^4), with typical error one-third that from
Numerov's method.  Requiring the differential 
equation to be satisfied at the mesh points results
in a set of difference equations, which are block 
tridiagonal and so are easily solved by relaxation or other standard methods.

 To produce a stereographic display the computer calculates

viewed from two separate points.  The resulting video
maps are stored on separate refresh bands of the 
rotating memory.  The two output signals are connected
to separate color guns of a color television monitor, 
thus creating a superimposed image on the screen.  Optical
separation is achieved by viewing the image 
through color filters.  The display is interactive and

Automated Printed Circuit Routing with a Stepping Aperture

A computer program for routing interconnections
on a two-sided printed circuit board with a 
regular pattern of lines, pins (terminals), and vias
(feed-through holes) is described.  In this program, 
each interconnection is given a planned routing-typically,
down from the upper pin, through a via, and 
horizontally to the lower pin.  From the top, a virtual
aperture (i.e. a long horizontal slit) is stepped 
down the board.  The planned routing is the basis for
rerouting interconnections within the aperture 
to resolve conflicts for lines and vias below the aperture
and to maximize the effective line usage. 
 If a conflict has not been resolved before the aperture
arrives at the lower pin,interconnections are 
deleted to resolve the conflict.  Extensions of this technique
to the control of crosstalk between routed 
interconnections and to the problem of obtaining
100 percent interconnect are also discussed.

Time-Sharing and Batch-Processing:  An Experimental

 This study is the first known attempt to evaluate 
two such systems for what may well be the predominant user
population within the next decade-the professionals 
who, as nonprogrammers, are using the computer as an
aid in decision-making and problem-solving rather 
than as a programming end in itself.  Statistically
and logically significant results indicate equal 
cost for usage of the two computer systems; however,
a much higher level of performance is attained by 
time-sharing users.  There are indications that significantly
lower costs would have resulted if the 
time-sharing users had stopped work when they reached
a performance level equal to that of the batch 
users.  The users' speed of problem-solving and their
attitudes made time-sharing the more favorable 
system.

Matrix representations and operations are examined

carefully designed matrix algorithms can lead to 
enormous savings in the number of page faults occurring

multiplication, and inversion algorithms shows 
that a partitioned matrix representation (i.e. one submatrix
or partition per page) in most cases induced 
fewer page faults than a row-by-row representation.
 The number of page-pulls required by these matrix 
manipulation algorithms is also studied as a function

Exclusive Simulation of Activity in Digital Networks
.W
A technique for simulating the detailed logic
networks of large and active digital systems 
is described.  Essential objectives sought are improved
ease and economy in model generation, economy 
in execution time and space, and a facility for handling
simultaneous activities.  The main results obtained 
are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral
model description, a reduction of manual 
tasks in converting Boolean logic into a structural model,
the elimination of manual processes in achieving 
exclusive simulation of activity, an event-scheduling
technique which does not deteriorate in economy
as the event queue grows in length, and a simulation
procedure which deals effectively with any mixture 
of serial and simultaneous activities.  The passage of
time is simulated in a precise, quantitative fashion 
and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronous

Digital computers are widely used for the
processing of information and data of all kinds, 
including the pictorial information contained in photographs
and other graphical representations.  Efficient 
conversion facilities for putting graphical information
into the computer and retrieving it in graphical 
form are therefore much needed.  One of the most commonly
employed devices for obtaining permanent graphical 
output from digital computers is the microfilm plotter.
 Regrettably, present models have no provision 
for producing images with a continuous gray scale or "half tones."
 In this note several programming techniques 
are described for obtaining half tone pictures from a
microfilm plotter under the control of a digital 
computer.  Illustrative examples of several methods are given.

Extremely portable subroutines are sometimes
needed for which moderate quality and efficiency 
suffice.  Typically, this occurs for library functions
(like random number generation and in core sorting) 
which are not entirely universal or are not used in a
standardized way.  The literature on random number 
generators does not seem to contain an algorithm that
meets requirements of this sort.  An extremely 
portable 8-line FORTRAN program is provided which based
or equal to 4).  While the small modulus which must 
be used to maintain portability prevents the quality
of the generator from being high, the generator 
compares well with the bounds established in the above mentioned paper.

The problem of obtaining optimal starting values
for the calculation of the square root using 
Newton's method is considered.  It has been pointed out
elsewhere that if relative error is used as the 
measure of goodness of fit, optimal results are not
obtained when the initial approximation is a best 
fit.  It is shown here that if, instead, the so-called
logarithmic error is used, then a best initial 
fit is optimal for both types of error.  Moreover, use
of the logarithmic error appears to simplify the 
problem of determining the optimal initial approximation.

Variable Length Tree Structures Having Minimum Average Search Time
.W
Sussenguth suggests in a paper (1963) that a
file should be organized as a doubly-chained tree 
structure if it is necessary both to search and to update
frequently.  Such a structure provides a compromise 
between the fast search/slow update characteristics of
binary searching and the slow search/fast update 
characteristics of serial searching.  His method, however,
contains the limiting restriction that all 
terminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree.  This paper
considers the effect of relaxing this restriction. 
 First, trees which have the property that a priori the
filial set of each node is well defined are studied. 
 It is proved that coding the nodes within each filial
set with respect to the number of terminal nodes 
reachable from each is necessary and sufficient to guarantee
minimum average search time.  Then the more 
general case (that is, where the entire structure of
the tree is changeable) is treated.  A procedure 
is developed for constructing a tree with a minimum
average search time.  A simple closed expression 
for this minimum average search time is obtained as
a function of the number of terminal nodes.  The 
storage capacity required to implement the doubly-chained
tree structure on a digital computer is also 
determined.  Finally, the total cost of the structure,
using Sussenguth's cost criterion, is computed. 
 It is shown that significant improvements in both
the average search time and the total cost can be 
obtained by relaxing Sussenguth's restriction that all
terminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree.

Some Criteria for Time-Sharing System Performance

Time-sharing systems, as defined in this article,
are those multiaccess systems which permit 
a terminal user to utilize essentially the full resources
of the system while sharing its time with other 
terminal users.  It is each terminal user's ability
to utilize the full resources of the system that 
makes quantitative evaluation of time-sharing systems
particularly difficult.  Six criteria are described 
which have been successfully used to perform first-level
quantitative time-sharing system performance 
evaluation.

Directed Random Generation of Sentences
.W
The problem of producing sentences of a transformational
grammar by using a random generator 
to create phrase structure trees for input to the lexical
insertion and transformational phases is discussed. 
 A purely random generator will produce base trees
which will be blocked by the transformations, and 
which are frequently too long to be of practical interest.
 A solution is offered in the form of a computer 
program which allows the user to constrain and direct
the generation by the simple but powerful device 
of restricted subtrees.  The program is a directed
random generator which accepts as input a subtree 
with restrictions and produces around it a tree which
satisfies the restrictions and is ready for the 
next phase of the grammar.  The underlying linguistic

Computing Polynomial Resultants: Bezout's Determinant
vs. Collins' Reduced P.R.S. Algorithm
.W
Algorithms for computing the resultant of two
polynomials in several variables, a key repetitive 
step of computation in solving systems of polynomial
equations by elimination, are studied.  Determining 
the best algorithm for computer implementation depends
upon the extent to which extraneous factors are 
introduced, the extent of propagation of errors caused by
truncation of real coefficients, memory requirements, 
and computing speed.  Preliminary considerations narrow
the choice of the best algorithm to Bezout's 
on sample problems conclusively show that Bezout's determinant
is superior in all respects except for 
p.r.s. algorithm is somewhat faster.  In particular 
Bezout's determinant proves to be strikingly superior in
numerical accuracy, displaying excellent stability 
with regard to round-off errors. Results of tests are reported in detail.

Estimates of Distributions of Random Variables
for Certain Computer Communications Traffic Models
.W
A study of multiaccess computer communications has
characterized the distributions underlying an elementary
 model of the user-computer interactive process.  The model used is
elementary in the sense that many of the random variables that
generally are of interest in computer communications studies can be
decomposed into the elements of this model.  Data were examined
from four operational multiaccess systems, and the model is shown to
be robust; that is each of the variables of the model has the
same distribution independent of which of the four systems is being examined. 
It is shown that the gamma distribution can be used to
describe the discrete variables.  Approximations to the gamma distribution
by the exponential distribution are discussed for the systems studied.

Optimum Merging from Mass Storage
.W
An algorithm is displayed which yields the merge orders such that the total
read time, defined to be the sum of seek time plus data-transfer
time, is minimized for a sort using mass storage. The analysis is
parameterized in terms of the ratio of seek time to the time it takes
to fill available core with records, and the file size in units
of core lengths; and thus it can be applied to any conventional
CPU/mass storage combination.  An explicit formula for total read
time is derived, in terms of the parameters, which correlates very
well with the total read time calculated using the optimum merge
orders yielded by the algorithm.  The formula involves the roots of a simple 
transcendental equation.  A short table of these roots
range of the parameters.  It is found that the normalized read
time for optimum merging on a given hardware configuration is proportional
to the file length times the logarithm of the file length.

keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations
of secondary index values in "buckets," it is possible to retrieve
all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of
fields by a single access to an index file, although each bucket may
be used for many combinations of values and a combination of
buckets may be required for a given query.  The method which, in its
degenerate case, becomes the conventional secondary index filing
scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination
of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination
of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to perform intersection
of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field
only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index
field appearing in a query has very few possible values.  Redundancy, in some 
cases, is the same as the secondary indexing method. In the general case, 
trade-off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists.

An Interactive Display for Approximation by Linear Programming
.W
An interactive program
with a graphical display has been developed for the approximation of
data by means of a linear combination of functions (including
splines) selected by the user.  The coefficients of the approximation
are determined by linear programming so as to minimize the error
in either the L1 or L-infinity norm.  Auxiliary conditions such as
monotonicity or convexity of the approximation can also be imposed. This
interactive system is described and several examples of its use are given.

The Use of Interactive Graphics To Solve Numerical Problems
.W
With the advent of on-line (time-sharing) computer systems
and graphic terminals, we have available a new dimension
in numerical problem solving capabilities.  Rather than simply use
the new power to achieve fast turnaround, we can develop interactive
routines which are easy to use and also take advantage of the
insight and visual capabilities of the human problem solver.  Several
on-line systems for general purpose mathematical problem solving
have already been implemented as well as some special purpose
systems for solving problems in a particular area such as ordinary
differential equations.  The advantage of restricting the problem
area is that the interface with a user can be greatly simplified.
In this paper we discuss some of the advantages accrued by such
systems and design considerations for interactive routines.  Furthermore,
an implementation of an on-line least squares data-fitting
program, PEG, is presented with results obtained from empirical
data.  In conclusion, area for future work in this field are discussed.

Transition Network Grammars for Natural Language Analysis

The use of augmented transition network grammars for the analysis

actions associated with the arcs of the grammar network allow for the reordering,
restructuring, and copying of constituents necessary to produce
deep-structure representations of the type normally obtained from a
transformational analysis, and conditions on the arcs allow for a
powerful selectivity which can rule out meaningless analyses and take
advantage of semantic information to guide the parsing.  The
advantage of this model for natural language analysis are discussed
in detail and illustrated by examples.  An implementation of an
experimental parsing system for transition network grammars is briefly 
described.

Increasing the Efficiency of Quicksort
.W
A method is presented for the analysis of various generalizations of
quicksort.  The average asymptotic number of comparisons needed is shown
 to be an log^2(n).  A formula is derived expressing a in terms of
the probability distribution of the "bound" of a partition.  This
 formula assumes a particularly simple form for a generalization already
considered by Hoare, namely, choice of the bound as median
of a random sample. The main contribution of this paper is another
generalization of quicksort, which uses a bounding interval instead
of a single element as bound.  This generalization turns out to
be easy to implement in a computer program.  A numerical approximation
shows that a = 1.140 for this version of quicksort compared with
1.386 for the original.  This implies a decrease in number of comparisons of 
18 percent; actual tests showed about 15 percent saving in computing time.

AMESPLOT-A Higher Level Data Plotting Software System
.W
AMESPLOT is an extensible software system designed to make the display of 
data as simple, painless, and neat as possible.  The system described is 
hardware-independent and has been implemented on a variety of installations,
of different manufacturers, having diverse configurations.  The elements 
common to all types of data plots are outlined and the way in which these 
elements may be combined into a system based on simple modules is demonstrated.
These modules are specified independently and are independent of the axis
systems or other attributes of the plot.  This enables plots of any
complexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules.  The
basic syntax of AMESPLOT is outlined, and a brief description is given
of its current utility software, consisting of "macros" to produce
self-scaled plots, formal tablets of text-interspersed with subplots,
map coastlines, and 3-D plots.  The system was formulate
d in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information,
and it should be fully integrable with user's program written
in most conventional higher languages.  The functions of positioning,
locating, and scaling (in the layout of multiple subplots) of
axes, labels, and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically
by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise.  The structuring 
of plots from multiple, independent, self-contained subplots is described.
Transformation, projection, scaling, rotation, or shifting of entire plots or 
subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible.  The user 
may interact freely with AMESPLOT at three levels, enabling him to construct 
his own data markers, alphabetic characters, and transformations, and
to produce a variety of artistic and other effects.

An Interactive Software System for Computers-Aided
Design:  An Application to Circuit Project
.W
The characteristics of an interactive software system, intended to constitute 
an interface between designer and computer during various steps of
the design process, are presented.  The main emphasis is given to the
description of the features of the two high level user oriented
languages, operating at different levels, on which the interaction
is based.  The first one is IMOL, an interactive monitor language,
which is designed to perform the overall and control functions
of the software system; its design criteria provide the user with
commands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform all
the functions needed in computer-aided circuit design.  The second one is 
COIF, a circuit oriented graphic language, which is designed
to describe, generate, and manipulate graphic problem specifications; 
it is an  extension of Fortran with graphic-type variables,
so that the designer who is familiar with Fortran need not learn a new 
language.  The application to computer-aided circuit design
is in particular examined; on the other hand, the adopted design
criteria provide sufficient generality to extend the use of the two languages 
to different computer-assisted applications.

The Allocation of Computer Resources-Is Pricing the Answer?
.W
The widespread use of complex third generation computing systems has led to a 
much broader concern about the means by which the resources of these systems
are allocated among the user community.  One means that is suggested
more and more frequently is a pricing procedure.  In this
paper the manner in which one would like to allocate computing resources
is considered, and then the extent to which a pricing mechanism fits this mold 
is discussed.  Inasmuch as pricing must serve as a rationing mechanism at 
times, consideration is given to the means by which prices can be adjusted 
effects of frequent price fluctuations.  Although the subject of pricing has
been given a lot of attention recently, a number of misconceptions
persist about its purpose and its operation.  An attempt is made to clarify 
some of these misunderstandings and to highlight the advantages and 
disadvantages and to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of pricing. Two
illustrative pricing systems are also discussed in order to demonstrate the 
applicability of pricing in quite different environments.

given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.  The new methods 
are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded 
information from that associated with conventional methods.  The reduction in 
space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of 
errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, 
applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident
hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.  In such 
applications, it is envisaged that overall performance
could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in
conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some
secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to "catch" the small
fraction of errors associated with new methods.  An example is discussed
which illustrates possible areas of application for the new
methods.  Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing
a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as
members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash
area to be used without increasing reject time.

Conversational Access to a 2048-Word Machine
.W
LAP6 is an on-line system running on a 2048-word LINC which provides full 
facilities for text editing, automatic filing and file maintenance, and 
program preparation and assembly.  It focuses on the preparation and editing 
of continuously displayed 23,040-character text strings (manuscripts) which
can be positioned anywhere by the user and edited by simply adding
and deleting lines as though working directly on an elastic scroll.
Other features are available through a uniform command set which itself can 
be augmented by the user.  The machine, although small,
aids program design by providing display scope and premarked
randomly addressable LINC tapes as standard items, in an environment
similar to that of a sophisticated terminal.  The tapes are logically 
similar to a disk.  Priority was given to the design of efficient
tape algorithms to minimize the limitations of the small memory.  Techniques 
developed for handling scroll editing, filing, and the layered system 
structure are outlined.  LAP6 is used by about 2000 people in 11 countries.  
Its design was strongly influenced by performance criteria established in 
interviews held with LINC users themselves during the specification period.

A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks
.W
Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the 
data is organized in the machine (the internal representation).  A prompting
service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory
solution.  Activities of users at terminals and most application
programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation
of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation 
models of the data.  In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed.
A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations,
and the concept of a universal form for data base relations,
and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced.  In
Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical
inference) are discussed and applied to the problems
of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.

Incorporating Origin Shifts into the QR
Algorithm for Symmetric Tridiagonal Matrices

The QR iteration for the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix can 
be accelerated by incorporating a sequence of origin shifts.  The origin shift
may be either subtracted directly from the diagonal elements of
the matrix or incorporated by means of an implicit algorithm.  Both
methods have drawbacks: the direct method can unnecessarily degrade small 
eigenvalues, while the implicit method can effectively loose the shift and 
thereby retard the convergence.  This paper presents a new method which has 
neither drawback.

and uses list processing techniques to sort and count them.
Each pair of words is then assigned a relative value that is a function
of the total frequency in the data of each correspondence found
in that pair of words.  The output is a list of all correspondence
types with their frequency of occurrence in the data, and a
separate listing of each correspondence with all word-pairs showing
that correspondence (unless their relative value is below an arbitrarily

On the Conversion of Decision Tables to Computer Programs
.W
The use of execution time diagnostics in pinpointing ambiguities in decision
tables is discussed.  It is pointed out that any attempt at resolving
ambiguities at compile time will, in general, be impossible.  It
is shown that, as a consequence, tree methods of converting decision
tables to programs are inadequate in regard to ambiguity detection.
Two algorithms for programming decision tables whose merits
are simplicity of implementation and detection of ambiguities at
execution time are presented. The first algorithm is for limited entry
decision tables and clarifies the importance of proper coding
of the information in the decision table.  The second algorithm programs
a mixed entry decision table directly without going through
the intermediate step of conversion to a limited entry form, thereby
resulting in storage economy.  A comparison of the algorithms and others 
proposed in the literature is made.  Some features of a decision table
to Fortran IV translator for the IBM 7044 developed by the authors are given.

An on-line digital computer processing system is considered in which an

being provided as a sequence of spoken words, and output to the user being 
audio responses from the machine.  The feasibility of implementing such a 
system with a FORTRAN-like algebraic compiler as the object processor is 
considered.  Details of a specific word recognition program are given.  This 
technique depends on three simplifying restrictions, namely, a "small"
vocabulary set, "known" speakers, and a "moment of silence"
between each input word.  Experimental results are presented giving
error rates for different experimental conditions as well as the machine 
resources required to accommodate several users at a time. The results show 
that at this time it is both economically and logically feasible to handle at 
least 40 users at a time with an IBM 360/65 computer.

GEDANKEN-A Simple Typeless Language Based on the
.W
GEDANKEN is an experimental programming language with the following 
characteristics.  (1) Any value which is permitted in some context of the 
language is permissible in any other meaningful context.  In particular,
functions and labels are permissible  results of functions and values
of variables.  (2) Assignment and indirect addressing are formalized
by introducing values, called reference, which in turn possess
other values.  The assignment operation always affects the relation
between some reference and its value,  (3) All compound data
structures are treated as functions.  (4) Type declarations are
not permitted.  The functional approach to data structures and the
use of references insure that any process which accepts some data
structure will accept any logically equivalent structure, regardless
of its internal representation.  More generally, any data structure
may be implicit; i.e. it may be specified by giving an arbitrary
algorithm for computing or accessing its components.  The existence of 
label variables permits the construction of coroutines,
quasi-parallel processes, and other unorthodox control mechanisms.
A variety of programming examples illustrates the generality of the language.
Limitations and possible extensions are discussed briefly.

superfluous operations.  Sequences of Matrices (and sequences of sequences
of matrices) are considered, and matrix operators areext
ended to sequence operators and cumulative operators.  Algorithms
are given which use symbol manipulation of matrix expressions so
as to find the forms best suited for computation.  These forms are
called normal forms.  Several completeness results are obtained
in the sense that for each expression an equivalent expression
in normal form can be found within a specified calculus.

Syntax-Directed Documentation For PL 360
.W
The language PL 360, together with its phrase structure grammar, is used as a 
concrete basis for illustrating an idea called syntax-directed documentation. 
This idea is (1) to use the phrase structure of a program to define the 
structure of a formal documentation for that program; (2) to use the syntactic 
types and identifiers in the resulting structure to trigger the automatic
formation of questions to the programmer, whose answers will
become part of that documentation; and (3) to provide automatic storage
and retrieval facilities so that other programmers who want
to understand or modify the program can access the resulting documentation,
which is cross-indexed in various ways by syntactic types
and objects.  A small PL 360 program, already found
in the literature, is worked out as an example.

PDEL-A Language for Partial Differential Equations
.W
Conventional computer methods available to solve
continuous system problems characterized by partial
differential equations are very time-consuming and cumbersome.  A
convenient, easy to learn and to use, high level problem oriented
language to solve and study partial differential equation problems
has been designed; a practical translator for the language has also
been designed, and a working version of it has been constructed
for a significant portion of the language.  This Partial Differential
Equation Language, PDEL, is outlined, and the highlights
of the translator are briefly summarized.

A Deductive Question-Answer for Natural Language Inference
.W
The question-answering aspects of the Protosynthex III pro
totype language processing system are described and exemplified in
detail.  The system is written in LISP 1.5 and operates on the Q-32
time-sharing system.  The system's data structures and their semantic
organization, the deductive question-answering formalism of
relational properties and complex-relation-forming operators, and
the question-answering procedures which employ these features in
their operation are all described and illustrated.  Examples of the
system's performance and of the limitations of its question-answering 
capability are presented and discussed.  It is shown that the
use of semantic information in deductive question answering greatly 
facilitates the process, and that a top-down procedure which works
from question to answer enables effective use to be made of this
information.  It is concluded that the development of Protosynthex
III into a practically useful system to work with large data
bases is possible but will require changes in both the data
structures and the algorithms used for question answering.

Various simple choices of error improvement estimates for the trapezoid
rule are studied to demonstrate a comparison procedure which is
relatively independent of the profusion of adaptive search and stopping
based comparison.  Behavior near the singularity was found
to be the dominant factor, and a new estimate, based on a constant
curvature assumption and parametric differences, was considered
slightly better than the other choices considered.

mainly based on the exchange algorithms of Remes (1934, 1935), for
their solution.  In this paper the application to problems of this
type of a general nonlinear algorithm due to Osborne and Watson
(1969) is considered.  Examples are given to illustrate that this
algorithm can give satisfactory results and, in particular, can
successfully solve problems which lead to difficulties

percent of the segments in use contain less than 40 words.  Although
the results are certainly not installation independent, and although they 
are particularly influenced by features of the B5500 ALGOL system, they 
should be relevant to the design of new computer systems,
especially with respect to the organization of paging schemes.

desirable to have many options when making decisions in the face of
uncertainty.  The mini-max procedure assigns to a MAX (MIN) node
the value of the highest (lowest) valued successor to that node. 
The M & N procedure assigns to a MAX (MIN) node some function of
the M (N) highest (lowest) valued successors.  An M & N procedure was
written in LISP to play the game of kalah, and it was demonstrated that 
procedure.  The statistical significance of important conclusions is given. 
Since information on statistical significance has often been lacking in papers

Several years of experience have led to the belief that the creative
design and evaluation of management information systems requires
machine language level.  Any machine used for exposition
should fulfill several criteria.  It should: (1) raise as few
spurious issues as possible; (2) allow, without undue effort, the
solution of interesting problems; (3) be capable of exposing all
outstanding issues of significance, capable of exposing all outstanding
issues of significance, within the chosen machine; (4) be
seful for pursuing issues in great depth when appropriate; (5) not
be committed to the equipment provided by any manufacturer; (6) be able to 
provide the student with diagnostic aids to a great depth;
(7) allow the student ready access to the machine; (8) be capable
of extension to expose new issues as they come along.  We have
constructed a simulated machine and its associated software which
meets these criteria.  This system, called the PRISM system,
is documented by a primer and a reference manual.

to be superior to the top-down and bottom-up algorithms studied by Griffiths

The Multistore Parser for Hierarchical Syntactic Structures
.W
A syntactic parser is described for hierarchical concatenation patterns
that are presented to the analyzer in the form of linear strings.  Particular
emphasis is given to the system of "significant addresses" by means
of which processing times for large-scale matching procedures
can be substantially reduced.  The description makes frequent use
of examples taken from the fully operational implementation of the
parser in an experimental English sentence analyzer.  By structuring
an area of the computer's central core storage in such a way
that the individual locations of bytes and bits come to represent the
data involved in the matching procedure, the shifting of information
is reduced to a minimum, and the searching of lists is eliminated
altogether.  The matches are traced by means of binary masks
and the state of single bits determines the operational flow of the
procedure.  The method could be implemented with any interpretive
grammar, provided it can be expressed by the functional classification
of the items composing the input hierarchical structures.

in addition to the methods applied in most LISP systems.

used: "local sequential" for lists created during compilation,
and "block level sequential" for those 
created dynamically.  A new garbage collection algorithm
has been introduced to make lists as compact 
as possible; partial garbage collection is performed after
each block exit instead of total garbage collection 
when storage is exhausted.  The algorithm does not use
the customary flagging procedure.  This combination 
of features has eliminated the need for a free list,
and effectively minimizes the number of pages used 
at any moment.

Reconstruction of Pictures from Their Projections
.W
There are situations in the natural sciences
and medicine (e.g. in electron microscopy and 
X-ray photography) in which it is desirable to estimate the
gray levels of a digital picture at the individual 
points from the sums of the gray levels along straight
lines (projections) at a few angles.  Usually, 
in such situations, the picture is far from determined
and the problem is to find the "most representative" 
picture.  Three algorithms are described (all using
this problem.  The algorithms are applicable in a large
and varied number of fields.  The most important 
uses may be the reconstruction of possibly asymmetric particles
from electron micrographs and three-dimensional 
X-ray analysis.

On Accurate Floating-Point Summation
.W
The accumulation of floating-point sums is
considered on a computer which performs t-digit 
base B floating-point addition with exponents in the range
-m to M.  An algorithm is given for accurately 
to yield the computed sum.  In all, qN+n-1 
t-digit floating-point additions are performed.  Under
usual conditions, the relative error in the computed 
sum is at most [(t+1)/v]B^(1-t) for some v.  Further,
with an additional q+n-1 t-digit additions, the 
computed sum can be corrected to full t-digit accuracy.
 For example, for the IBM/360 (B=16, t=14, M=63, 
m=64), typical values for q and n are q=2 and n=32. 
[(t+1)/v]B^(1-t) = 4x16^-13.

Optimizing the Polyphase Sort

sorting procedure are examined.The optimum 
algorithm based on minimizing the total number of unit
strings read is displayed.  The logic of this 
algorithm is rather complicated; hence, several other
new dispersion algorithms with more straightforward 
logic are presented.  Of the simple dispersion algorithms
discussed, the  Horizontal is best.  It does 
approximately one-fourth to one and one-half percent
less reading and writing than most algorithms in 
use today.  An additional two and one-fourth to three
percent improvement can be achieved by utilizing 
the Modified Optimum Algorithm.  This algorithm is relatively

Display Procedures
.W
Although the use of structured display files
is widespread in interactive computer graphics, 
these structures present a number of problems which
tend to restrict their generality and usefulness. 
 This paper discusses some of these problems, and suggests an
alternative approach to display system 
design which avoids the use of structured display files.
 This technique employs display procedures to 
generate information for display.  By including transformations
within calls to these procedures it is 
possible both to simplify the specification of pictures
and to speed up their generation.  Display procedures 
permit picture elements to be defined conditionally
and also facilitate the processing of inputs from 
pointing devices.  The paper is illustrated by examples
from aversion of the EULER language in which 
display procedures were implemented.

University to teach portions of an undergraduate

 Initial measures of effectiveness, student

Canonical Structure in Attribute Based File Organization
.W
A new file structure for attribute based retrieval
is proposed in this paper.  It allows queries 
involving arbitrary Boolean functions of the attribute-value
pairs to be processed without taking intersections 
of lists.  The structure is highly dependent on the
way in which the file is to be used and is uniquely 
determined by the specification of the allowed queries.
 Thus, for example, the structure for retrieval 
on the basis of ranges of values of a given attribute would
be very different from one where only retrieval 
on the basis of a single value is permitted.  The file
organization being proposed is based on the atoms 
of a Boolean algebra generated by the queries.  The desirable
properties claimed for this structure are 
proved, and file maintenance questions are discussed.

Algebraic simplification is examined first from

efficient system.  First we describe various techniques
akin to substitution.  These techniques can be 
used to decrease thesize of an expression and make it
more intelligible to a user.  Then we delineate 
the spectrum of approaches to the design of automatic simplification
capabilities in an algebraic manipulation 
system.  Systems are divided into five types.  Each type
provides different facilities for the manipulation 
and simplification of expressions. Finally we discuss
some of the theoretical results related to algebraic 
simplification.  We describe several positive results
about the existence of powerful simplification 
algorithms and the number-theoretic conjectures on which
they rely.  Results about the nonexistence of 
algorithms for certain classes of expressions are included.

Subexpression Ordering in the Execution of Arithmetic Expressions
.W
An arithmetic expression can often be broken
down into its component subexpressions.  Depending 
on the hardware environment in which the expression is
to be executed, these subexpressions can be evaluated 
in serials, in parallel, or in a combination of these
modes.  This paper shows that expression execution 
time can be minimized only if consideration is given to
the ordering of the subexpressions.  In particular, 
subexpressions should be executed in order of decreasing
memory and processor time requirements.  This 
observation is valid for configurations ranging from
a uniprocessor with an unbuffered main memory to 
multiprocessor with a "cache" buffer memory.  If the
number of subexpressions which can be executed in 
parallel exceeds the number of available processors,
then execution of some of these subexpressions must 
be postponed.  A procedure is given which combines this
requirement with the earlier ordering considerations 
to provide an optimal execution sequence.

Buffer Allocation in Merge-Sorting
.W
A fixed buffer allocation for merge-sorting
is presented here which minimizes the number of 
input-output operations for a given order of merge.
 When sorting on movable arm disks, the number of 
seeks is equal to the number of input-output operations,
and the seek time usually controls the sort 
time.  First some standard terminology is introduced. 
Then the input buffer allocation method is described, 
followed by an analysis of the improvement to be expected
over more conventional allocation.  This analysis 
makes use of a particular distribution function.  An
analysis of a completely different distribution 
is given which yields similar results.  This suggests
that the results do not depend on a particular 
distribution function.  An optimum output buffer size
is also determined.  It is concluded that this 
buffering allocation can significantly reduce the time
of merge sorting on movable arm disks when the 
input data are not random, and that this output buffer
allocation should be used whether the data is 
random or not.

An Algorithm for the Blocks and Cutnodes of a Graph
.W
An efficient method is presented for finding
blocks and cutnodes of an arbitrary undirected 
graph.  The graph may be represented either (i) as an
ordered list of edges or (ii) as a packed adjacency 
matrix.  If w denotes the word length of the machine
employed, the storage (in machine words) required 
for a graph with n nodes and m edges increases essentially
as 2(m+n) in case (i), or (n^2)/win case 
(ii).  A spanning tree with labeled edges is grown,
two edges finally bearing different labels if and 
only if they belong to different blocks.  For both representations
the time required to analyze a graph 
on n nodes increases as n^G where G depends on the type
of graph, 1 <= G <= 2, and both bounds are attained. 
 Values of G are derived for each of several suitable
families of test graphs, generated by an extension 
of the web grammar approach.  The algorithm is compared
in detail with that proposed by Read for which 
1 <= G <= 3.

 Graspe consists of a type of directed graph data structure

semantics).  The definition of Graspe here is solely in

 Only when the language is implemented is assignment
of an explicit syntax necessary.  An example of

It is assumed that there is a similarity of
function between the data names of a programming

 The two functions are discussed in terms of the

to which they overlap. It is suggested that there 
is some similarity between the idea of a file directory
and a storable object of type context.  Manipulations 
with contexts are then discussed at length.  It is noted
context manipulation.  Whereas a function can be 
regarded as the abstraction based upon the first two terms of
the expression Lambda(name list)(expression)(value list), 
it is found that a context can be viewed as an abstraction

A Note on Compiling Fixed Point Binary Multiplications
.W
An algorithm is developed for compiling, as
a sequence of shifts, additions,and subtractions, 
many fixed point binary multiplications involving a
constant.  The most significant characteristics of 
the algorithm are the simplicity of the test which
determines if the algorithm should be applied and 
the degree to which it "suggests" efficient object code.

Numerical Properties of the Ritz-Trefftz Algorithm for Optimal Control
.W
In this paper the Ritz-Trefftz algorithm is applied
to the computer solution of the state regulator 
problem.  The algorithm represents a modification of
the Ritz direct method and is designed to improve 
the speed of solution and the storage requirements to
the point where real-time implementation becomes 
feasible.  The modification is shown to be more stable
computationally than the traditional Ritz approach. 
 The first concern of the paper is to describe the
algorithm and establish its properties as a valid 
and useful numerical technique.  In particular such useful
properties as definiteness and reasonableness 
of condition are established for the method.  The second
part of the paper is devoted to a comparison 
of the new techniques with the standard procedure of
numerically integrating a matrix Riccati equation 
to determine a feedback matrix.  The new technique is
shown to be significantly faster for comparable 
accuracy.

Computer Science: A Conceptual Framework for Curriculum Planning

Two views of computer science are considered:
a global view which attempts to capture broad 
characteristics of the field and its relationships to
other fields, and a local view which focuses on 
the inner structure of the field.  This structure is presented
in terms of the kinds of knowledge, problems, 
and activities that exist within the discipline, as
well as the relations between them.  An approach 
to curriculum planning in computer science is presented
which is guided by the structure of the field, 
by the fact that change is an important feature of the
situation, and by the expectation that computer
science will continue to increase its working contacts with other disciplines.

An Approach to the Optimum Design of Computer Graphics Systems
.W
Display system designers are faced with the
difficult task of selecting major subsystems in 
an intelligent way.  Each subsystem is chosen from large
numbers of alternatives; the selection is based 
on considerations such as system response time, system
cost, and the distribution of data storage and 
processing between the graphics processor and its supporting
data processing system.  The work reported 
here develops an objective, quantitative design procedure
and helps give a better understanding of now 
to  configure display systems.  This is accomplished by
means of a mathematical model of a computer driven 
graphics system.  The parameters of the model are functions
of the capabilities of the graphics hardware 
and of the computational requirements of the graphics application.
 The model can be analyzed using numerical 
queueing analysis or simulation to obtain an average
response time prediction.  By combining the model 
with an optimization, the best graphics system configuration,
subject to a cost constraint, is found 
for several applications.  The optimum configurations
are in turn used to find general display system 
design guidelines.

Systematic generation of a specific class
of permutations fundamental to scheduling problems 
is described.  In a nonoriented complete graph with
n vertices, Hamitonian circuits equivalent to .5(n 
- 1)! specific permutations of n elements, termed rosary
permutations, can be defined.  Each of them 
corresponds to two circular permutations which mirror-image
each other, and is generated successively 
by a number system covering 3*4*...*(n-1) sets of edges.
 Every set of edges {E[k]}, 1 <= E[k] <= k, 
3 <= k <= (n-1) is determined recursively by constructing
a Hamiltonian circuit with k vertices from 
a Hamiltonian circuit with k-1 vertices, starting with
the Hamiltonian circuit of 3 vertices.  The basic 
operation consists of transposition of a pair of adjacent
vertices where the position of the pair in 
the permutation is determined by {E[k]}.  Two algorithms
treating the same example for five vertices 
are presented.  It is very easy to derive all possible n!
permutations  from the .5(n - 1 )! rosary permutations 
be cycling the permutations and by taking them in the
reverse order-procedures which can be performed 
fairly efficiently by computer.

How To Keep the Addresses Short
.W
An algorithm is presented for minimizing the
sum of the lengths of the blocks of coding produced 
by an assembler or compiler when (1) the length of
each computer instruction is assumed to be either 
"long" or "short" ("long," if the memory location addressed
is more than a predetermined distance from 
the current location; "short," otherwise), and (2)
there are blocks of instructions whose beginnings 
(origins) are separated by prespecified amounts. For example,
some computers permit either 8-bit addressing 
(interpreted relative to the location counter) or full
16-bit addressing of all of memory.  When assembling 
or compiling two or more blocks of instructions which
have many mutual references in such a computer, 
there is no simple iterative procedure for keeping
as many of the addresses short as possible.  This 
paper demonstrates that a wide class of problems of
this type can be formulated as covering problems 
solvable by means of elementary arithmetic operations
on the column vectors of a ternary matrix.

A Man-Machine Approach Toward Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem
.W
The traveling salesman problem belongs to an
important class of scheduling and routing problems. 
 It is also a subproblem in solving others, such as
the warehouse distribution problem.  It has been 
attacked by many mathematical methods with but meager
success.  Only for special forms of the problem 
or for problems with a moderate number of points can
it be solved exactly, even if very large amounts 
of computer time are used.  Heuristic procedures have
been proposed and tested with only slightly better 
results.  This paper describes a computer aided heuristic
technique which uses only a modest amount of 
computer time in real-time to solve large (100-200)
point problems.  This technique takes advantage of 
both the computer's and the human's problem-solving
abilities.  The computer is not asked to solve the 
problem in a brute force way as in many of today's heuristics,
but it is asked to organize the data for 
the human so that the human can solve the problem easily.
 The technique used in this paper seems to 
point to new directions in the field of man-machine interaction
and in the field of artificial intelligence.

Introduction to "Feature Analysis of
Generalized Data Base Management Systems"

This paper is a separately published introduction
to a main report which analyzes the features 
of generalized data base management systems.  This introduction
gives a review of the current state of 
the art in these systems and discusses the differences
and similarities between capabilities found in 
host language systems and those found in self-contained
systems.  After some discussion of the problems 
of data independence and binding,the four user levels
are identified and described.  Technical problems 
facing future designers are described.  The first of
these is that of handling existing stored data and 
the next is that of providing more complex data structures
than those already available in conventional 
programming languages.  The problem of high level interrogation
and update functions acting on network 
structures is mentioned, followed by a discussion of the
problem of catering to a high volume of transactions 
initiated from terminals by parametric users-the lowest
level of user.  The use of Cobol as a basis for 
further development work is considered at some length
with respect to data structures, host language 
capabilities, and self-contained capabilities.  This
section also assesses the effect of the Data Base 
Task Group proposals.  The final section outlines the
ten major topics in the main body of the full report.

Dynamic Microprogramming: Processor Organization and Programming
.W
A dynamically microprogrammed processor is characterized
by a small (4^k 64-bit word) read-write 
"micro" storage.  The access time of this storage is
similar to the cycle time of the machine (50-100 
nsec).  This microstorage is used to contain both data
and subroutines.  The (micro) instructions in 
such a processor differ from the conventional in that
they perform only purely combinatorial operations; 
sequencing is under the control of the microinstruction.
The presence of the read-write microstorage 
permits a more flexible assignment of resources than the
read-only storage.  In particular, the processor 
developed in this paper stresses the simultaneous operation
(within the microinstruction) of the adder, 
shifter, masker, and testing facilities of the processor.
 A microassembly language is developed and 
the overhead involved in subroutine linkages is analyzed.
 The efficiency of a flexible software linkage 
scheme is examined as to its overhead for various subroutine
characteristics.  Finally, three examples 
of problem-oriented programming are considered and the
resulting coding is compared against a System/360 
assembly language version, with the technology normalized.

Storage Utilization in a Memory Hierarchy When Storage
Assignment Is Performed by a Hashing Algorithm
.W
The utilization of storage is studied in a two-level
memory hierarchy.  The first storage level, 
which is the fast store, is divided into a number of
storage areas.  When an entry is to be filed in 
the hierarchy, a hashing algorithm will attempt to
place the entry into one of these areas.  If this 
particular area is full, then the entry will be placed
into the slower second-level store, even though 
other areas in the first-level store may have space
store.This expression gives a measure of how effectively
the first-level store is being used.  By means 
of examples, storage utilization is then studied as a
function of the hashing algorithm, the number of 
storage areas into which the first-level store is divided
and the total size of the first-level store.

induced by those specifications is proved, and

defined functions into iterative programs, frequently
with a major gain inefficiency.  It is emphasized

recursion, the principle of mathematical induction

Application of Game Tree Searching Techniques
to Sequential Pattern Recognition
.W
A sequential pattern recognition (SPR) procedure
does not test all the features of a pattern 
at once.  Instead, it selects a feature to be tested.  After
receiving the result of that test, the procedure 
either classifies the unknown pattern or selects another
feature to be tested, etc.  Medical diagnosis 
is an example of SPR.  In this paper the authors suggest
that SPR be viewed as a one-person game played 
against nature (chance).  Virtually all the powerful techniques
developed for searching two-person, strictly 
competitive game trees can easily be incorporated either
directly or by analogy into SPR procedures. 
 In particular, one can incorporate the "mini average
backing-up procedure" and the "gamma procedure," 
which are the analogues of the "minimax backing-up procedure"
and the "alpha-beta procedure," respectively. 
 Some computer simulated experiments in character recognition
are presented.  The results indicate that 
the approach is promising.

On the Probability Distribution of the Values of Binary Trees

An integral equation is derived for the generating
function for binary tree values, the values 
reflecting sorting effort. The analysis does not assume
uniformly distributed branching ratios, and 
therefore is applicable to a family of sorting algorithms
discussed by Hoare, Singleton, and van Emden. 
 The solution to the integral equation indicates that
using more advanced algorithms in the family makes 
only minor reductions in the expected sorting effort,
but substantially reduces the variance in sorting 
effort.  Statistical tests of the values of several
thousand trees containing up to 10,000 points have 
given first, second, and third moments of the value distribution
function in satisfactory agreement with 
the moments computed from the generating function.  The
empirical tests, as well as the analytical results, 
are in agreement with previously published results for the
first moment in the cases of uniform and nonuniform 
distribution of branching ratio, and for the second moment
in the case of uniform distribution of branching 
ratio.

Experiments in Automatic Learning for a Multipurpose Heuristic Program
.W
An automatic learning capability has been developed
and implemented for use with the MULTIPLE 
(MULTIpurpose Program that LEarns) heuristic tree-searching
program, which is presently being applied 
to resolution theorem-proving in predicate calculus.
MULTIPLE's proving program (PP) uses two evaluation 
functions to guide its search for a proof of whether
or not a particular goal is achievable.  Thirteen 
general features of predicate calculus clauses were created
for use in the automatic learning of better 
evaluation functions for PP.  A multiple regression
program was used to produce optimal coefficients 
for linear polynomial functions in terms of the features.
 Also, automatic data-handling routines were 
written for passing data between the learning program
and the proving program, and for analyzing and 
summarizing results.  Data was generally collected for
learning (regression analysis) from the experience 
of PP.  A number of experiments were performed to test
the effectiveness and generality of the learning 
program. Results showed that the learning produced dramatic
improvements in the solutions to problems 
which were in the same domain as those used for collection
learning data.  Learning was also shown to 
generalize successfully to domains other than those used
for data collection.  Another experiment demonstrated 
that the learning program could simultaneously improve
performance on problems in a specific domain and 
on problems in a variety of domains.  Some variations
of the learning program were also tested.

A Policy-Driven Scheduler for a Time-Sharing System
.W
The service received by a process from a time-sharing
operating system can be characterized 
by a resource count SUM{w[i]R[ij]} where R[ij] is the
number of units of service received by process 
i from resource i and w[i] is the cost per unit of the
service.  Each class of users can be characterized 
by a policy function which specifies the amount of service
a user who belongs to this class should receive 
as a function of time.  Priority changes dynamically
as a function of the difference between the service 
promised to the user by the policy function and the service
he actually receives.  A scheduling and swapping 
algorithm which keeps the resource count of each process
above its policy function will provide the specified 
level of service.  Overhead can be reduced by avoiding
swaps of process which have received at least 
his level of service.  The algorithm has been implemented
in a general purpose operating system, and 
it has provided significantly better service to interactive
and to batch jobs than the previous scheduler.

Pattern Width at a Given Angle

That the pattern feature "width as a function

is demonstrated in this paper, which is a review of
the width concept in pattern recognition and the 
geometrical concept itself.  The object of the work
is to clarify how the word description can be made 
precise so that computer algorithms for feature extraction
may be obtained; the focus is on the theoretical 
subject matter.  The results consist of a set-theoretic
definition of width-at-angle, a theorem relating 
it to the pattern boundary radius vector, and descriptions
of alternate widths.  All widths are calculated 
for an illustrative example; graphical and tabular comparisons
are given.  Substantial variation in width-at-angle 
magnitude is found.  The principal conclusion is that
the set-theoretic width-at-angle is a useful pattern 
feature when it can be easily computed.  Further investigation
of the information contained in only part 
of a width function is recommended for cases where
computation of width-at-angle is difficult.

Three cyphers allegedly authored by Thomas
Jefferson Beale in 1822 have been the subject of 
intensive study for over 100 years.  Generations of
cryptanalysts have expended untold man-years, thus 
far without success, attempting tode code them; vast armies
of fortune hunters and treasure seekers have 
devoted Herculean labors to digging up the rolling hills
of Virginia trying to locate the promised bonanza. 
 The history of pertinent activities would fill volumes,
yet serious students of cryptography have always 
had nagging doubts about the cyphers' authenticity.
 It has been alleged that the "known solution" to 
Cypher Number Two: 115, 73, 24, 818, 37, 52, 49,...("I
have deposited in the County of Bedford about 
four miles from Buford's in an excavation or vault...")
with the aid of an unsanitized version of the 
Declaration of Independence was merely a superb, imaginative,
and grandiose hoax perpetrated ages ago 
for whatever reasons.  Modern computer technology could
obviously perform signature analyses the process 
of encoding itself so as to yield new clues and deeper
insights into their construction.  For the benefit 
of the uninitiated, the encoding method used in the
second cypher employs a specified document whose 
words are simply numbered consecutively, and first letters
of these words are sought out at random to 
match the letters of these words are sought out at random
to match the letters of the clear text or message. 
 The sequence of numbers corresponding to these matches
is then written down as the final code.  While 
primitive, the process has the advantage of relative
security until the source document becomes known; 
at that moment the cypher can be decoded even by second
graders.  The work now completed with the help 
of our UNIVAC 1108 includes numerous analytical studies
of the Beale cyphers and various types of simulations. 
 For example, we have turned the entire process of
simulated encoding by various schemes over to the 
machine and analyzed the signatures of these synthetic
codes; we have also encoded various messages by 
hand, using different texts and a variety of methods to
obtain their signatures. These simulations provide 
convincing evidence that the signatures are both process
and data dependent; they indicate also very 
strongly that Mr. Beale's cyphers are for real and that
it is merely a matter of time before someone 
finds the correct source document and locates the
right vault in the common-wealth of Virginia.

On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules

This paper discusses modularization as a mechanism
for improving the flexibility ad comprehensibility 
of a system while allowing the shortening of its development
time.  The effectiveness of a "modularization" 
is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the
system into modules.  A system design problem is
presented and both a conventional and unconventional
decomposition are described.  It is shown that the 
unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages
for the goals outlined.  The criteria used in 
arriving at the decompositions are discussed.  The
unconventional decomposition, if implemented with 
the conventional assumption that a module consists of
one or more subroutines, will be less efficient 
in most cases.  An alternative approach to implementation
which does not have this effect is sketched.

language using a general purpose text editor, and incremental
processing of changes without frequent 
recompilation of entire routines.  The essential points
of the method are: (1) the syntax of the language 
is restricted insof ar as which constructs may occur
on lines; (2) an internal data structure (called 
the skeleton) is maintained to represent the statement
structure; (3) the recompilation is partially 
batched in the sense that recompilation of modified lines
does not occur until the last of a set of editing 
commands has been received; and (4) the parsing and
compilation are factored into two parts, that done 
on individual lines and that done globally to
handle the relationships between the lines.

Dynamic Partitioning for Array Languages

The classical process of partitioning an array

array language operation.  Various modes of partitioning
are defined for different types of arrays, so 
that subarrays may vary over the original array in
a nearly arbitrary manner.  These definitions are 
motivated with several realistic examples to illustrate
the value of partitioning for array languages. 
 Of general interest is the data structure for partitioning.
 This consists of dynamic tree structures 
which are used to derive and maintain the array control
information.  These are described in sufficient 
detail to be of value in the design of other array languages.
 The description presented in this paper 
is implemented in a new array language, OL/2, currently

The Conversion of Limited-Entry Decision Tables
to Optimal and Near-Optimal Flowcharts: Two New 
Algorithms
.W
Two new algorithms for deriving optimal and
near-optimal flowcharts from limited entry decision 
tables are presented.  Both take into account rule frequencies
and the time needed to test conditions. 
 One of the algorithms, called the optimum-finding algorithm,
leads to a flowchart which truly minimizes 
execution time for a decision table in which simple rules
are already contracted to complex rules.  The 
other one, called the optimum-approaching algorithm, requires
many fewer calculations but does not necessarily 
produce the optimum flowchart.  The algorithms are first
derived for treating decision tables not containing 
an ELSE-rule, but the optimum-approaching algorithm
is shown to be equally valid for tables including 
such a rule.  Both algorithms are compared with existing
ones and are applied to a somewhat large decision 
table derived from a real case.  From this comparison two
conclusions are drawn.  (1) The optimum-approaching 
algorithm will usually lead to better results than comparable
existing ones and will not require more, 
but usually less, computation time.(2) In general, the
greater computation effort needed for applying 
the optimum-finding algorithm will not be justified
by the small reduction in execution time obtained.

A Model for Type Checking
.W
Most current programming languages treat computation
over different classes of objects (e.g. 
numbers, strings, labels and functions).  For correct
compilation and execution, the following question 
then arises: is a program properly constructed so that
its operations and operands are compatible?  The 
activity of answering this question is usually called
type checking.  This paper attempts to isolate 
the notion of type checking and presents a partial
solution to the type checking problem based on the 
notions of abstraction and application of functions. 
In particular, a program is mapped into an expression 
within a decidable subset of the Lambda calculus, which
characterizes the type relations within the program 
and eliminates all other information.  The determination
of the type-wise correctness or incorrectness 
of the program is resolved by reducing its corresponding
Lambda calculus expression to one of two normal 
forms, the constant "correct" for a type-wise correct
program or the constant "error".  An application 
to type checking in Algol 60 is made, and the attendant
problems faced for any notion of type checking 
are discussed.

Conversion of Decision Tables By Rule Mask Method Without Rule Mask
.W
Two algorithms for generating computer programs
from decision tables are described.  The algorithms 
allow handling limited entry, extended entry, and mixed
entry tables.  The algorithms are based on the 
rule mask method but need not have the masks at execution
time.  They perform the logical operations 
immediately rather than at the end of the interpreting
process.  Execution time can be considerably reduced 
by instantly marking rules which are not applicable (Algorithms
1 and 2) or conditions which are already 
tested (Algorithm 2).  The new algorithms combine to a
certain degree the advantages of mask methods with 
those of tree methods.

A system is described for generating English
sentences from a form of semantic nets in which 
the nodes are word-sense meanings and the paths are
primarily deep case relations.  The grammar used 
by the system is in the form of a network that imposes
an ordering on a set of syntactic transformations 
that are expressed as LISP functions.  The generation
algorithm uses the information in the semantic 
network to select appropriate generation paths through
the grammar.  The system is designed for use as 
a computational tool that allows a linguist to develop
and study methods for generating surface strings 
from an underlying semantic structure.  Initial finding
with regard to form determiners such as voice, 
form, tense, and mood, some rules for embedding sentences,
and some attention to pronominal substitution 
are reported.  The system is programmed in LISP
1.5 and is available from the authors.

The inversion of a particular integral equation
of the first (Fredholm) kind is the basic problem 
considered.  The strategy which yielded success consisted
of three essential points: (1) fit the known 
experimental data by a curve with properties which derive
from properties of the (as yet unknown) function; 
(2) stabilize the computation for the unknown function
by using singular value decomposition; (3) constrain 
the unknown function approximation (since it represents
a probability distribution) to be nonnegative. 
 A number of test cases are presented. One set of actual
experimental data is analyzed with the procedures

Thinning Algorithms on Rectangular, Hexagonal, and Triangular Arrays

In this report three thinning algorithms are
developed: one each for use with rectangular, 
hexagonal, and triangular arrays.  The approach to the
development of each algorithm is the same.  Pictorial 
results produced by each of the algorithms are presented
and the relative performances of the algorithms 
are compared.  It is found that the algorithm operating
with the triangular array is the most sensitive 
to image irregularities and noise, yet it will yield
a thinned image with an overall reduced number of 
points.  It is concluded that the algorithm operating in
conjunction with the hexagonal array has features 
which strike a balance between those of the other two arrays.

Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems
.W
A cellular array is a two-dimensional, checkerboard
type interconnection of identical modules 
(or cells), where each cell contains a few bits of
memory and a small amount of combinational logic, 
and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors
in the array.  The chief computational advantage 
offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed
achieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel 
processing.  In this paper it is shown that cellular
arrays are inherently well suited for the solution 
of many graph problems.  For example, the adjacency
matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array; 
each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array,
and typical row and column operations are readily 
implemented by simple cell logic.  A major challenge
in the effective use of cellular arrays for the 
solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms
that exploit the possibilities for parallelism, 
especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently
serial.  In particular, several parallelized 
algorithms are presented for the solution of certain
spanning tree, distance, and path problems, with 
direct applications to wire routing, PERT chart analysis,
and the analysis of many types of networks. 
 These algorithms exhibit a computation time that in
many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n, 
where n is the number of nodes in the graph.  Straightforward
cellular implementations of the well-known 
serial algorithms for these problems require about n
steps, and noncellular implementations require from 
n^2 to n^3 steps.

Computers and Employment

The relationship of computers and automation
to employment is part of the more general relation 
of technological change to employment.  The most obvious
effect is that increase in productivity due 
to technology can eliminate jobs.  Technology affects
the individual worker, in the nature and amount 
of his work, and in his attitudes toward that work.  Technological
change affects the occupational structure 
of the entire labor force.  Because of the central importance
of these effects, the impact of technology 
has been the subject of extensive study by economists, sociologists,
political scientists, and psychologists. 
 Even within a single discipline, studies are often contradictory,
and conclusions are colored by political 
overtones.  We wish to delineate some of the issues,
and present arguments given to support different 
viewpoints.

Requirements for Advanced Programming Systems for List Processing
.W
List processing systems should be designed to
facilitate production of large programs to manipulate 
large complex symbolic data stores.  This paper presents
an overview of a number of system features which 
the author feels are important to improve the productivity
of programmers working in such domains.  A 
system view it taken, rather than focusing just on language
features, since algorithms must be not only 
coded in a language form, but debugged, modified, made
efficient, and run on data.  Because of this general 
framework,the requirements specified are applicable
to the design of advanced programming systems for 
a wide range of applications.  Three aspects of programming
systems are highlighted: good interactive 
facilities, programmable control structures, and sophisticated
data communication mechanisms.  Interactive 
features are described to facilitate program composition,
entry, testing, debugging, editing, optimization, 
and packaging.  Implementation of a generalized environment
structure model specified would allow programming 
of various control regimes including multiprocesses,
coroutines and backtracking.  Alternative methods 
of procedure invocation required include invocation
by pattern and by monitoring condition.  The  need 
for extended data forms, storage management, and extensibility
are stressed, as is the duality of data 
retrieval and function evaluation.  Syntax directed
input and output of data would facilitate use of 
complex data stores.

systems, and they all ran into similar 
problems.  A number of university projects,though not
directly comparable to those of the manufacturers, 
have contributed greatly to a better understanding

Operating System Performance
.W
An overview of the current and future positions
with respect to operating system performance 
is given.  While a great deal of information and a large
number of models for subsystems have been developed, 
gaps still exist in out knowledge.  Because of the
severe interactions between the various subsystems 
of an operating system, an overall model of the total
system must be developed to be able to analyze 
and design the performance aspects of an operating system
although such total system designs are exceptional 
today, it is projected that they will become increasingly
more common and necessary in the near future. 
 Such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impact
on the way we go about modularizing operating 
and computer systems.

Structured Multiprogramming
.W
This paper presents a proposal for structured
representation of multiprogramming in a high 
level language.  The notation used explicitly associates
a data structure shared by concurrent processes 
with operations defined on it.  This clarifies the meaning
of programs and permits a large class of time-dependent 
errors to be caught at compile time.  A combination of
critical regions and event variables enables the 
programmer to control scheduling of resources among
competing processes to any degree desired.  These 
concepts are sufficiently safe to use not only within
operating systems but also within user programs.

On the Interface Between Computers and Data Communications Systems
.W
Future systems that combine computers, digital
terminals, and communications equipment present 
design optimization problems that require reconsideration
of the traditional functional responsibilities 
of the respective subsystems.  Several "standard" interfaces,
by means of which computers and digital 
terminals connect to the communications systems will
be required.  When specifying these interfaces, 
consideration must be given to problems of coordination,
synchronization, error control, signaling, stream 
multiplexing, and switch control, in addition to minimizing
the technological interdependence of specific 
subsystem designs.  A focus on some of the problems is
obtained in a discussion of a detailed specification 
for a particular computer-communications system interface.

 Then the prospects for a general theory of functions

to algorithmically generate many properties of solutions
to differential equations.  Such a theory is 
preferable to a less general effort to make algebraic

Blocks-A New Data type for SNOBOL4

A new data type, called a block, has been implemented
for SNOBOL4.  A block is a three-dimensional 
aggregate of characters in the form of a right parallelepiped,
best thought of as a three-dimensional 
extension to a string.  (The third dimension is used for
overstriking.)  Blocks may be printed, concatenated 
in any of three dimensions, and merged on the basis
of program-defined connection points.  Some blocks 
adapt in size and shape to their environment.  Blocks
and their operations are mainly used for composing 
printable output.  A variety of graphical problems (including
flowcharting, bargraphs, logic diagrams, 
mathematical-equation formation, and text justification
and preparation) have been programmed on a printer 
in what appears to be an easy and natural way.  In addition
to these somewhat specialized applications, 
blocks appear to be a good general purpose device-independent
output formation mechanism especially suitable 
for nonnumerical work.  The concept of a block is largely
language independent.That is, blocks require 
little in the way of specialized syntax and could readily
be absorbed into the external structure of 
most programming languages.

Interference Between Communicating Parallel Processes
.W
Various kinds of interference between communicating
parallel processes have been examined by 
these solutions.  In this paper a system of parallel
processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds 
from one state S (i.e. a collection of pertinent data
values and process configurations) to a next state 
S' in accordance with a transition rule S --> S'.  A
set of such rules yields sequences of states, which 
dictate the system's behavior.  The mutual exclusion problem
and the associated subproblems are formulated 
as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or
of the existence of certain sequences.  A mechanical 
proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove
the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the 
incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect
to any of the interference properties.  It is shown 
how to calculate transition rules from the "partial
rules" by which the individual processes operate. 
 The formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
processes as well as to software processes, and
symmetry between processes is not required.

A Proposal To Establish a Pseudo Virtual Memory via Writable Overlays
.W
Many computer systems solve executable storage
size problems for large programs by using overlays. 
 However, it appears that no one overlay scheme contains
a well-balanced combination of the most useful 
capabilities which are found in various existing techniques.
 A proposal is presented which utilizes 
several of the best capabilities from existing schemes
and is complemented by several additional features, 
e.g. writable overlays.  The writable overlay capability
provides a virtual memory effect, although the 
programmer may still be required to design the overlay
configuration.  Since overlay structuring is a 
complex task, several tools (including a graphic display)
are included in the proposal in order to aid 
the programmer in the design.  The content of overlays
is briefly discussed, and it is noted that many 
of the details of the final overlay configuration may be decided after the fact.

On the Optimization of Performance of Time-Sharing Systems by Simulation
.W
A simulation model of a time-sharing system
with a finite noncontiguous store and an infinite 
auxiliary store is used to study the variation of system
parameters such as store size, number of jobs 
allowed to execute simultaneously, job-scheduling algorithm,
etc.  The effects of these variations on 
a measure of system performance is used to ascertain which
of the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling 
algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization,
and which of the parameters not normally 
controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked
effect on system performance.  System performance 
is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.
 It is shown that significant improvements 
in the measure of system performance can be obtained by
using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting 
the optimum round-robin cycle time.  It appears that these
features would benefit from optimization whereas 
other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm
affect system performance in a predictable 
manner and would not benefit from optimization.  Features
not normally under the control of the scheduling 
algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure
of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, 
the size of the store, and the speed of the CPU.  A comparison
is made between the results of the simulation 
model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented
nonpreemptive time-sharing systems.  The comparison 
is found to be very favorable.

conventional computation of the cosine transformation 
by recurrence relation is numerically unstable, particularly
at the low frequencies which have the largest 
effect upon the integral.  Second, in case the automatic
scheme should require refinement of the sampling, 
storage is required to save the integrand values after
the cosine transformation is computed.  This second

As experience with use of on-line operating
systems has grown, the need to share information 
among system users has become increasingly apparent.
 Many contemporary systems permit some degree of 
sharing.  Usually, sharing is accomplished by allowing
several users to share data via input and output 
of information stored in files kept in secondary storage.
 Through the use of segmentation, however, 
Multics provides direct hardware addressing by user and
system programs of all information, independent 
of its physical storage location.  Information is stored
in segments each of which is potentially sharable 
and carries its own independent attributes of size and access
privilege.  Here, the design and implementation 
considerations of segmentation and sharing in Multics
are first discussed under the assumption that all 
information resides in large, segmented main memory. 
Since the size of main memory on contemporary systems 
is rather limited, it is then shown how the Multics
software achieves the effect of a large segmented 
main memory through the use of the Honeywell
645 segmentation and paging hardware.

An Improved Index Sequential Access Method Using Hashed Overflow
.W
The Index Sequential Access Method (ISAM) is
one of the most important file management systems 
used with moveable head disk devices.  This study investigates
the use of an unconventional method of 
treating overflow records.  The method is to use hashing
techniques to allocate space for such records. 
 If certain conditions are satisfied, this is superior
to the conventional ISAM method of chaining the 
overflow records via linked list techniques.  These conditions are:
long overflow chains with significant 
overflow; lack of tight disk space constraints; record
keys which are small compared to the total record 
size; and significant use of the file in the index as opposed
to the sequential mode.  Using hashed overflow, 
the time to locate a record is dependent not on the total
volume of overflow records as in conventional 
ISAM, but on the percentage use of space dedicated to overflow records.

A method is presented of determining which
parts of three-dimensional objects are visible and 
which are invisible when the objects are rotated about
some axis.  This paper describes a polygon comparison 
scheme in which the relationships of two polygons can
be classified into tree types, and also discusses 
how the relationship is changed for each pair of polygons
under rotation about some axis.  A rotation 
table is defined for each pair of polygons, which remains
fixed as long as rotation is about one axis 
and provides a means of rapidly determining the visible
and hidden line relationship between two polygons. 
 Additional work must be done to extend this approach
to simultaneous rotation about several axes.

On the Implementation of Security Measures in Information Systems
.W
The security of an information system may be
represented by a model matrix whose elements are 
decision rules and whose row and column indices are
users and data items respectively.  A set of four 
functions is used to access this matrix at translation
and execution time.  Distinguishing between data 
dependent and data independent decision rules enables
one to perform much of the checking of security 
only once at translation time rather than repeatedly
at execution time.  The model is used to explain 
security features of several existing systems, and serves
as a framework for a proposal for general security 
system implementation within today's languages and operating systems.

Properties of the Working-Set Model
.W
A program's working set W(t,T) at time t is
the set of distinct pages among the T most recently 
referenced pages.  Relations between the average working-set size,
the missing-page rate, and the interreference-interval 
distribution may be derived both from time-average definitions
and from ensemble-average (statistical) 
definitions. An efficient algorithm for estimating these
quantities is given.  The relation to LRU (least 
recently used) paging is characterized.  The independent-reference
model, in which page references are 
statistically independent, is used to assess the effects
to interpage dependencies on working-set size 
observations. Under general assumptions, working-set
size is shown to be normally distributed.

A Comparative Analysis of Disk Scheduling Policies
.W
Five well-known scheduling policies for movable
head disks are compared using the performance 
criteria of expected seek time (system oriented)and expected
waiting time (individual I/O request oriented). 
 Both analytical and simulation results are obtained.
 The variance of waiting time is introduced as 
another meaningful measure of performance, showing possible
discrimination against individual requests. 
 Then the choice of a utility function to measure total
performance including system oriented and individual 
request oriented measures is described.  Such a function
allows one to differentiate among the scheduling 
policies over a wide range of input loading conditions.
 The selection and implementation of a maximum 
performance two-policy algorithm are discussed.

Formalization of a well-defined synchronization
mechanism can be used to prove that concurrently 
running processes of a system communicate correctly.
 This is demonstrated for a system consisting of 
many sending processes which deposit messages in a buffer
and many receiving processes which remove messages 
from that buffer.  The formal description of the synchronization
mechanism makes it very easy to prove 
that the buffer will neither overflow nor underflow,
that senders and receivers will never operate on 
the same message frame in the buffer nor will they run into a deadlock.

A Hardware Architecture for Implementing Protection Rings
.W
Protection of computations and information
is an important aspect of a computer utility.  In 
a system which uses segmentation as a memory addressing
scheme, protection can be achieved in part by 
associating concentric rings of decreasing access privilege
with a computation.  This paper describes 
hardware processor mechanisms for implementing these rings
of protection.  The mechanisms for implementing 
these rings of protection. The mechanisms allow cross-ring
calls and subsequent returns to occur without 
trapping to the supervisor.  Automatic hardware validation
of references across ring boundaries is also 
performed.  Thus, a call by a user procedure to a protected
subsystem (including the supervisor) is identical 
to a call to a companion user procedure.  The mechanisms
of passing and referencing arguments are the 
same in both cases as well.

An Operating System Based on the Concept of a Supervisory Computer
.W
An operating system which is organized as a
small supervisor and a set of independent processes 
are described.  The supervisor handles I/O with external
devices-the file and directory system-schedules 
active processes and manages memory, handle errors, and
provides a small set of primitive functions which 
it will execute for a process.  A process is able to
specify a request for a complicated action on the 
part of the supervisor (usually a wait on the occurrence
of a compound event in the system) by combining 
these primitives into a "supervisory computer program."
 The part of the supervisor which executes these 
programs may be viewed as a software implemented "supervisory
computer."  The paper develops these concepts 
in detail, outlines the remainder of the supervisor, and
discusses some of the advantages of this approach.

of the aspects of human composition.  Five samples of
its output are presented and discussed.  It was 
discovered that although the fragments show many of
the characteristics of popular melodies, they have 
a strangely alien sound.  It is theorized that this

Optimizing Binary Trees Grown With a Sorting Algorithm

Items can be retrieved from binary trees grown
with a form of the Algorithm Quicksort in an 
average time proportional to log n, where n is the number

 An algorithm to do this is presented.  The use of this

MUSE: A Model To Understand Simple English
.W
MUSE is a computer model for natural language
processing, based on a semantic memory network 
like that of Quillian's TLC.  MUSE, from a Model to Understand
Simple English, processes English sentences 
of unrestricted content but somewhat restricted format.
 The model first applies syntactic analysis to 
eliminate some interpretations and then employs a simplified
semantic intersection procedure to find 
a valid interpretation of the input.  While the semantic
processing is similar to TLC's, the syntactic 
component includes the early use of parse trees and special
purpose rules.  The "relational triple" notation 
used during interpretation of input is compatible with MUSE's
memory structures, allowing direct verification 
of familiar concepts and the addition of new ones. 
MUSE also has a repertoire of actions, which range 
from editing and reporting the contents of its own
memory to an indirect form of question answering. 
 Examples are presented to demonstrate how the model interprets
text, resolves ambiguities, adds information 
to memory, generalizes from examples and performs various actions.

Pictorial Pattern Recognition and the
.W
The availability of interactive, three-dimensional,
computer graphics systems coupled to powerful 
digital computers encourages the development of algorithms
adapted to this environment.  Pictorial pattern 
recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches
to the experimental data.  Application of standard 
pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact
that the cross-correlation between a model and 
the correct structure cannot be computed because of
a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data. 
 However, it is possible to compute an upper bound to such
a cross-correlation.  A simple example demonstrates 
that this information can be the basis of a technique
for structure determination that can make effective 
use of an interactive graphics system. Model building
by cross-correlations has intrinsic advantages 
over usual crystallographic techniques based on the
autocorrelation or Patterson function, especially 
for large structures.  This is significant, for crystallography
of biological macromolecules hasbeen 
and will continue to be a field of intense interest.

paramodulation.  The new rules embody the transitivity 
of partial orderings and the close relationship between
 predicates.  A program has been developed using 
a modified version of these rules.  This new theorem-prover
has been found to be very powerful for solving 
problems involving partial orderings.  This paper presents
a detailed description of the program and 
a comprehensive account of the experiments that have been performed with it.

A Scan Conversion Algorithm with Reduced Storage Requirements

Most graphics systems using a raster scan output
device (CRT or hardcopy) maintain a display 
display file.  The scan conversion algorithm described
here uses a linked list data structure to process 
the lines of the drawing in strips corresponding to
groups of scan lines.  A relatively small primary 
memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image
for a group of scan lines.  When this portion 
of the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for
the next portion.  Because of the list processing

Dynamic Verification of Operating System Decisions
.W
Dynamic verification of a decision implies
that every time the decision is made there is a 
consistency check performed on the decision using independent
hardware and software.  The dynamic verification 
of operating system decisions is used on the PRIME system
being designed and constructed at the University 
of California, Berkeley.  PRIME is an experimental time-sharing
which is to have the properties of continuous 
availability, data privacy, and cost effectiveness.
 The technique of dynamic verification allows the 
construction of an operating system which does not make certain
decisions improperly even in the presence 
of a single hardware or software fault.  Furthermore,
multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only 
if the faults happen to reinforce each other.  On PRIME,
dynamic verification is used to ensure that 
one user's information cannot become available to another
user gratuitously even in the presence of a 
single hardware or software fault.the amount of additional
hardware and software required for dynamic 
verification can be modest.

Control Structures in Illiac IV Fortran
.W
As part of an effort to design and implement
a Fortran compiler on the ILLIAC IV, an extended 
Fortran, called IVTRAN, has been developed.  This language
provides a means of expressing data and control 
structures suitable for exploiting ILLIAC IV parallelism.
 This paper reviews the hardware characteristics 
of the ILLIAC and singles out unconventional features
which could be expected to influence language (and 
compiler) design.  The implications of these features for
data layout and algorithm structure are discussed, 
and the conclusion is drawn that data allocation rather than
code structuring is the crucial ILLIAC optimization 
problem.  A satisfactory method of data allocation is
then presented.  Language structures to utilize 
this storage method and express parallel algorithms are described.

General Performance Analysis of Key-to-Address
Transformation Methods Using an Abstract File 
Concept
.W
This paper presents a new approach to the analysis
of performance of the various key-to-address 
transformation methods.  In this approach the keys in
a file are assumed to have been selected from the 
key space according to a certain probabilistic selection
algorithm.  All files with the same number of 
keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted
in accordance with the algorithm, and the 
average performance of the transformation methods on
these files will be used as the potential of these 
methods.  Using this analysis, methods with the same overall
performance can be classified and key distributions 
partial to certain transformations can be identified.
 All this can be done analytically.  The approach 
is applied to a group of transformation methods
using files whose keys are selected randomly.

A Model and Stack Implementation of Multiple Environments
.W
Many control and access environment structures
require that storage for a procedure activation 
exist at times when control is not nested within the
procedure activated.  This is straightforward to 
implement by dynamic storage allocation with linked
blocks for each activation, but rather expensive 
in both time and space.  This paper presents an implementation
technique using a single stack to hold 
procedure activation storage which allows retention
of that storage for durations not necessarily tied 
to control flow.  The technique has the property that,
in the simple case,it runs identically to the 
usual automatic stack allocation and deallocation procedure.
 Applications of this technique to multitasking, 
coroutines, backtracking, label-valued variables, and
functional arguments are discussed.  In the initial 
model, a single real processor is assumed, and the implementation
assumes multiple-processes coordinate 
by passing control explicitly to one another.  A multiprocessor
implementation requires only a few changes 
to the basic technique, as described.

Design of Tree Structures for Efficient Querying
.W
A standard information retrieval operation is
to determine which records in a data collection 
satisfy a given query expressed in terms of data values.
 The process of locating the desired responses 
can be represented by a tree search model.  This paper
poses an optimization problem in the design of 
such trees to serve a well-specified application. The
problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily 
the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical
techniques.  On the other hand, it is potentially 
useful for the comparison it affords between observed
performance and that of an intuitively attractive 
ideal search procedure.  As a practical application
of such a model this paper considers the design of 
a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation
of data and shows that essentially the 
same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal
search tree or a bit-vector tree.  An experimental 
study of a small formatted file illustrates the concepts.

have single rules or that the cost of testing conditions
be equal.  It is thus more general than the

trees with standard AVL trees and with balanced 
trees on the basis of mean retrieval time, of amount
of restructuring expected, and on the worst case 
of retrieval time.  It is shown that, by permitting
imbalances of up to five units, the retrieval time 
is increased a small amount while the amount of restructuring
required is decreased by a factor of ten. 
 A few theoretical results are derived, including the correction
of an earlier paper, and are duly compared

Fen-An Axiomatic Basis for Program Semantics
.W
A formal system is presented which abstracts
the notions of data item, function, and relation. 
 It is argued that the system is more suitable than set
theory (or its derivatives) for the concise and 
accurate description of program semantics.  It is shown
how the system can be used to build composite 
data types out of simper ones with the operations of rowing,
structuring, and uniting.  It is also demonstrated 
that completely new primitive types can be introduced
into languages through the mechanism of singleton 
data types.  Both deterministic and nondeterministic
functions are shown to be definable in the system. 
 It is described how the local environment can be modeled
as a data item and how imperative statements 
can be considered functions on the environment.  The
nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, 
and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced
into the system.  The technique is contrasted 
with the use of the paradoxical combinator, Y.  The
questions of local and global environments and of 
various modes of function calling and parameter passing
are touched upon. The theory is applied to the 
proof of several elementary theorems concerning the semantics
of the assignment, conditional, and iterative 
statements.  An appendix is included which presents in
detail the formal system governing webs and fen, 
the abstractions used informally in the body of the paper.

A Learning Program Which Plays Partnership Dominoes

A learning program has been written is BASIC
to play four-player partnership dominoes.  Because 
dominoes is a game of incomplete information, the program
uses somewhat different principles of artificial 
intelligence from those used in programs for games
of complete information, such as checkers, chess, 
and go.  The program was constructed to use a "strategy
signature table" which classifies board situations 
through the interactions of game parameters. Each entry
in the table contains adaptively determined 
weights indicating the advi sability of various strategies.
 Once chosen, a strategy then employs probability 
analysis and linear polynomial evaluation to choose
a move.  Our program wins approximately two-thirds 
of its games in tournament situations, and has defeated championship players.

Curriculum Recommendations for Graduate Professional
Programs in Information Systems: Recommended 
Addendum on Information Systems Administration
.W
An addendum to the Report of the ACM Curriculum
is proposed. The proposed addendum is to include in the curriculum
a course on Information Systems administration. 
It is important for two reasons: (1) the systems designer
must understand the administrative framework 
in which he must operate to work effectively, and (2) an
important objective of the curriculum recommendations 
is to prepare the future manager of the computer activity.
 It is felt that the importance of these two 
reasons justifies the addition of the recommended course.
 The course is outlined in the format of the 
original report.

Teaching "About Programming"
.W
This paper presents the goals and organization
of a course about programming designed to provide 
entering students in a graduate program with a cultural
enrichment in their professional lives.  The 
students are expected to have taken at least two programming
courses prior to this one and, therefore, 
to be familiar with at least two programming languages,
both as students and users.  Teaching someone 
how to program is similar to teaching him to play a musical
instrument: neither skill can be taught-they 
must be learned.  However, the teacher still serves
several vital purposes: to present a set of rules 
for producing well-formed utterances; to offer numerous
demonstrations of his own skill; and to function 
as an involved critic.  Finally, the teacher is the
source of information about the process in which 
the student is involved.

The Distribution of a Program in Primary and Fast Buffer Storage
.W
A virtual memory computer system with a fast
buffer (cache) memory between primary memory and 
the central processing unit is considered.  The optimal
distribution of a program between the buffer 
and primary memory is studied using the program's lifetime
function.  Expressions for the distribution 
of a program which maximizes the useful fraction of
the cost-time integral of primary and fast buffer 
storage are obtained for swapping and nonswapping buffer management policies.

prevent deadlocks.  This paper presents a method,

COKO III: The Cooper-Koz Chess Program
.W
COKO III is a chess player written entirely
in Fortran.  On the IBM 360-65, COKO III plays 
a minimal chess game at the rate of .2 sec cpu time
per move, with a level close to lower chess club 
play.  A selective tree searching procedure controlled
by tactical chess logistics allows a deployment 
of multiple minimal game calculations to achieve some optimal
move selection.  The tree searching algorithms 
conceptually simple.  In addition, an interesting 
phenomenon called a tree searching catastrophe has plagued
of the Fischer set.  A clear distinction between tree
pruning and selective tree searching is also made. 
 Representation of the chess environment is described
along with a strategical preanalysis procedure 
that maps the Lasker regions.  Specific chess algorithms
are described which could be used as a command 
structure by anyone desiring to do some chess program
experimentation.  A comparison is made of some 
mysterious actions of human players and COKO III.

A Note on Information Organization and Storage
.W
Since the logical structure of a data base
can be represented by a tree or graph, it is quite 
natural for us to view the process of designing a data
base as that of constructing a tree or a graph. 
 A general method for constructing such a tree or a graph
is provided.  There are three important elements 
in this general construction method; namely, a set of
binary relations, an algorithm for constructing 
subsets of a set, and an algorithm for selecting an
element from the given set of objects.  The use of 
different relations and algorithms results in different
information structures, as list, tree, ring, 
etc.  Thus the problem of information organization and
storage is reduced to that of defining relations 
and formulating algorithms under a given set of constraints.
 The results presented may be valuable to 
designers as useful design concepts, and may serve as
a basis for developing a formal theory on the subject.

a descriptive stage hypothesis is presented. 
 It is suggested that the planning, organizing, and controlling

computer resource will change in character over a period
of time, and will evolve in patterns roughly 
correlated to four stages of the computer budget: Stage
I (computer acquisition), Stage II (intense system 
development), Stage III (proliferation of controls), and
Stage IV (user/service orientation).  Each stage 
is described and related to individual tasks for managing the computer resource.

A computer generated graphic method, which

overstrikes) of various shades of darkness, where a
dark symbol corresponds to a small dissimilarity. 
 The plots, applied to a data matrix before clustering
and to the rearranged matrix after clustering, 
show at a glance whether clustering brought forth any
distinctive clusters.  A well-known set of data 
consisting of the correlations of 24 psychological tests
is used to illustrate the comparison of groupings 
by four methods of factor analysis and two methods of cluster analysis.

On the Near-Optimality of the Shortest-Latency-Time-First
Drum Scheduling Discipline
.W
For computer systems in which it is practical
to determine the instantaneous drum position, 
a popular discipline for determining the sequence in which
the records are to be accessed is the so-called 
shortest-latency-time-first, SLTF, discipline.  When
a collection of varying-length records is to be 
accessed from specified drum positions, it is known that
the SLTF discipline does not necessarily minimize 
the drum latency time.  However, we show that the total
time to access the entire collection for any 
SLTF schedule is never as much as a drum revolution
longer than a minimum latency schedule.

Synchronizing Processors with Memory-Content-Generated Interrupts
.W
Implementations of the "Lock-Unlock" method
of synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor 
system usually require uninterruptable, memory-pause type instructions.
 An interlock scheme called read-interlock, 
which does not require memory-pause instructions, has
real-time requirements.  The read-interlock method does
require a special"read-interlock" instruction 
in the repertoire of the processors and a special "read-interlock"
cycle in the repertoire of the memory 
modules.  When a processor examines a "lock" (a memory
location) with a read-interlock instruction, it 
will be interrupted if the lock was already set; examining
a lock immediately sets it if it was not already 
set (this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle). 
Writing into a lock clears it.  Having the processor 
interrupted upon encountering a set lock instead of
branching is advantageous if the branch would have 
resulted in an effective interrupt.

Efficient Multiprogramming Resource Allocation and Accounting
.W
Although sometimes thought of as only a component
of time-sharing operation, multiprogramming 
can involve broader questions of resource allocation,
since fairness is not required to meet a response 
criterion.  In a multiprogrammed system, it may serve
maximal resource use to be unfair, for example 
by holding an input/output channel idle for a program
while it completes a small amount of processor 
usage, enabling further use of the channel.  Several
applications of this principle are given, and it 
is suggested that a multiprogramming executive might
dynamically adjust its allocation algorithms to 
gain efficiency.  Allocation of resources is closely connected
to accounting for those resources, raising 
the problems of repeatability, minimal uncharged overhead,
and relative weighting of charges for dependent 
resources.  Since weightings may depend on allocation
algorithms, these are not arbitrary accounting 
parameters.  Often the only repeatable accounting is
one which omits an extensive overhead will be paid, 
and should multiprogramming prove efficient, overcharges
will result.  Multiprogramming turns on allocation 
of the memory resource essential to control of other
resources.  The general suggestions for allocation 
and accounting are applied to this question, and some
details provided for the case of a monitor which 
controls a virtual-memory machine.

A Practical Approach to Managing Resources and Avoiding Deadlocks
.W
Resource scheduling and allocation can be expensive
with regard to time and space in multiprogramming 
or time-sharing environments involving large numbers of
tasks and resources with conflicting requirements. 
 Detection and/or prevention of deadlocks can require
massive amounts of additional overhead if efficient 
usage of resources is to be maintained.  A resource
management program is described which uses linked 
lists along with other techniques to overcome a large
portion of this overhead.  The program, which is 
currently running as part of a large scale general purpose
operating system, keeps resources relatively 
active but does not detect or prevent all deadlocks

A Statistical Study of the Accuracy of Floating Point Number Systems
.W
This paper presents the statistical results
of tests of the accuracy of certain arithmetic 
systems in evaluating sums, products and inner products,
and analytic error estimates for some of the 
computations.  The arithmetic systems studied are 6-digit
hexadecimal and 22-digit binary floating point 
number representations combined with the usual chop
and round modes of arithmetic with various numbers 
of guard digits, and with a modified round mode with guard
digits.  In a certain sense, arithmetic systems 
differing only in their use of binary or hexadecimal number
representations are shown to be approximately 
statistically equivalent inaccuracy.  Further, the
usual round mode with guard digits is shown to be 
statistically superior in accuracy to the usual chop
mode in all cases save one.  The modified round 
mode is found to be superior to the chop mode in all cases.

Asymmetric Memory Hierarchies
.W
 A study is presented of some of the system
implications of memory hierarchies in which the 
backing or secondary store has a very small read time,
relative of both the time required for writing 
and to the read time of conventional backing storage
devices. Several analytic models are introduced, 
and it is shown that such hierarchies may operate in
ways which differ from those of more conventional 
hierarchies.  In particular, it is shown that it may not
be necessary to multiprogram in such a situation. 
 In the past, backing storage devices have been roughly
symmetric with respect to their read and write 
times.  This situation may not continue, as several
devices are currently under development which may 
have a very small read-time/write-time ratio.  This study
places particular emphasis on one such system-the 
RCA read/write holographic optical memory.

Implementation of High Level Language Machine

Computing machines which directly execute

proposed in the past.  This report describes the actual
implementation of such a machine: it is a computer 
whose "machine language" is APL.  The machine is fully
operational and correctly executes almost all 
of the APL operations on scalars, vectors, and arrays.
 The machine automatically allocates memory, executes 
statements, calls functions, converts numbers from one
type to another, checks subscripts, and automatically 
detects many types of programmer errors.

Design and Implementation of a Diagnostic Compiler for PL/I
.W
PL/C is a compiler for a dialect for PL/I.  The
design objective was to provide a maximum degree 
of diagnostic assistance in a batch processing environment.
 For the most part this assistance is implicit 
and is provided automatically by the compiler. The most remarkable
limit is reached. This requires that the compiler repair
errors encountered during both translation 
 To accommodate these extensions to PL/I without 
abandoning compatibility with IBM compiler PL/C permits
"pseudo comments"-constructions whose contents 
can optionally be considered either source test or comment.
 In spite of the diagnostic effort PL/C is 
a fast and efficient processor.  It effectively demonstrates
that compilers can provide better diagnostic 
assistance than is customarily offered, even when a sophisticated
source language is employed, and that 
this assistance need not be prohibitively costly.

A study is made of the way in which asynchronous
time division multiplexing changes the stochastic 
nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer
and, consequently, affects the performance 
of a time-shared computer-communications system.  It is
concluded that while, for certain values of system 
parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the
performance of the computer (model), in the sense 
that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these
improvements are offset by the transmission delays 
imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or
no change in the computer-communications system 
performance.  Analytical and simulation results are
based on the model of the computer-communications 
system being an M/D/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem
with a single exponential server (the computer). 
 Analytical results include a general description of the
output process of an M/D/1 queue and the conditions 
under which this output process is approximately Poisson.

Common Phrases and Minimum-Space Text Storage
.W
A method for saving storage space for text
strings, such as compiler diagnostic messages, is 
described.  The method relies on hand selection of a
set of text strings which are common to one or more 
messages.  These phrases are then stored only once. 
The storage technique gives rise to a mathematical 
optimization problem: determine how each message should
use the available phrases to minimize its storage 
requirement.  This problem is nontrivial when phrases
which overlap exist.  However, a dynamic programming 
algorithm is presented which solves the problem in time
which grows linearly with the number of characters 
in the text.  Algorithm 444 applies to this paper.

An Overview of the ISPL Computer System Design
.W
This paper explores the advantages of the concurrent
design of the language, operating system, 
and machine (via microcode) to create an interactive programming
laboratory.  It describes the synergistic 
effect that the freedom to move and alter features from
one of these domains to another has had on the 
design of this system (which has not been implemented).
 This freedom simplified both incremental compilation 
and the system's addressing structure, and centralized the
communication mechanisms enabling the construction 
of hierarchical subsystems.  It also suggested an important
new concept for operating systems: separation 
of the scheduling from the maintenance functions in resource
allocation. This separation enables incorporation 
of new scheduling algorithms (decision of what to do) without
endangering the system integration (correctly 
performing the scheduling decisions).

A Software Design and Evaluation System

A critical failure of current software system
design and implementation methodology is that 
the performance of a proposed design is not evaluated
before it is actually implemented.  In this paper 
the reasons for this failure are explored, and a new methodology
which overcomes many of the difficulties 
is proposed.  A system which integrates performance evaluation
with design and implementation is described. 
 This system is based on a simple, high level language
which is used to describe the evolving system 
at all stages of its development.  The source language
description is used as direct input to performance 
analysis and simulation routines.  Using the performance
information obtained from these routines as 
feedback, the problems which adversely affect performance
are detected early enough so that they can 
be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system.

The Use of Grammatical Inference for Designing Programming Languages

Both in designing a new programming language

is faced with the problem of deriving a "natural" grammar

as input to a grammatical inference algorithm.  The algorithm
then constructs a grammar which is a reasonable 
generalization of the examples submitted by the designer.
 The implementation is presently restricted 
to a subclass of operator precedence grammars, but
a second algorithm is outlined which applies to a 
larger class of context-free grammars.

Reduction of a Band-Symmetric Generalized Eigenvalue Problem
.W
An algorithm is described for reducing the
generalized eigenvalue problem Ax = lambda Bx to 
an ordinary problem, in case A and B are symmetric band
matrices with B positive definite.  If n is the 
order of the matrix and m the bandwidth, the matrices
A and B are partitioned into m-by-m blocks; and 
the algorithm is described in terms of these blocks.
 The algorithm reduces the generalized problem to 
an ordinary eigenvalue problem for a symmetric band
matrix C whose bandwidth is the same as A and B. 
 The algorithm is similar to those of Rutishauser and
Schwartz for the reduction of symmetric matrices 
to band form.  The calculation C requires order mn^2
operation.  The round-off error in the calculation 
errors being largely determined by the condition of B with respect to inversion.

A Graph Formulation of a School Scheduling Algorithm

The problem classically titled "The Examination
Schedule Problem" takes various forms in the 
literature.  Most of these formulations can be presented
in the terminology of classical Network Theory. 
 One such formulation is:  Given a nondirected network,
partition its nodes into a minimal number of 
subsets such that no two members of the same subset
are connected by anarc.  An obvious lower limit 
to this number is the size of the largest strongly connected
length examinations where W(I) is the number of periods
for exam I.  The object of this paper is to generalize 
the definition of largest strongly connected subgraph
to include the weighting of nodes, to present an 
approximate algorithm which usually finds the largest
strongly connected subgraph, and to discuss the 
application of this algorithm to the solution of
school scheduling and exam scheduling problems.

Computer Generation of Gamma Random Variates
.W
When the shape parameter, a, is integral,
generating gamma random variables with a digital 
computer is straightforward.  There is no simple method
for generating gamma random variates with non-integral 
shape parameters.  A common procedure is to approximately
generate such random variables by use of the 
so-called probability switch method.  Another procedure,
which is exact, is due to Johnk.  This paper 
presents a rejection method for exactly generating
gamma random variables when a is greater than 1.  
The efficiency of the rejection method is shown to
be better than the efficiency of Johnk's method.  
The paper concludes that when a is non-integral the following
mix of procedures yields the best combination 
of accuracy and efficiency: (1) when a is less than
1, use Johnk's method; (2) when 1 is less than a 
and a is less than 5, use the rejection method; (3) when
a is greater than 5, use the probability switch 
method.

Register Allocation Via Usage Counts

This paper introduces the notion of usage counts,
shows how usage counts can be developed by 
algorithms that eliminate redundant computations, and
describes how usage counts can provide the basis 
for register allocation.  The paper compares register
allocation based on usage counts to other commonly 
used register allocation techniques, and presents evidence
which shows that the usage count technique 
is significantly better than these other techniques.

A Method for Composing Simple Traditional Music by Computer
.W
A method is described for composing musical
rounds by computer.  This method uses some music 
theory plus additional heuristics.  Fundamental to the
method is a set of productions together with sets 
of applicability rules and weight rules which operate
on the productions deciding when and to what extent 
they are available for use.  Several rounds generated
by the computer implementation of the method are 
presented.  Generally, the resultant music sounds mediocre
to the professional although usually pleasing 
to the layman.  It appears that full-blown music theory
is not needed for rounds--all the hardware required 
for structural levels is not necessary for these pieces.
 The author has tried to address both musicians 
and computer scientists.

This paper describes LPARS, a locally-organized

which contains ambiguity and error. The system 
is locally-organized in the sense that it builds local
parse structures from reliable word candidates 
recognized anywhere in an input utterance.  These local
structures are used as "islands of reliability" 
to guide the search for more highly garbled
words which might complete the utterance.

Improving Locality by Critical Working Sets
.W
A new approach to program locality improvement
via restructuring is described.  The method 
is particularly suited to those systems where primary memory
is managed according to a working set strategy. 
 It is based on the concept of critical working set, a
working set which does not contain the next memory 
reference.  The data the method operates upon are extracted from
a trace of the program to be restructured. 
 It is shown that, except in some special cases, the
method is not optimum.  However, the experimental 
results obtained by using the method to restructure an
interactive text editor and the file system module 
of an operating system have shown its substantial superiority
over the other methods proposed in the 
literature.

On Generation of Test Problems for Linear Programming Codes
.W
Users of linear programming computer codes have
realized the necessity of evaluating the capacity, 
effectiveness, and accuracy of the solutions provided
by such codes.  Large scale linear programming 
codes at most installations are assumed to be generating correct
solutions without ever having been "bench-marked" 
by test problems with known solutions.  The reason for
this failure to adequately test the codes is that 
rarely are there large problems with known solutions readily
available.  This paper presents a theoretical 
justification and an illustrative implementation of a method
for generating linear programming test problems 
with known solutions.  The method permits the generation
of test problems that are of arbitrary size 
and have a wide range of numerical characteristics.

paper proposes a gauge which provides for the creation
of a restricted class of data structures but ensures 
the correctness of the program.  This is accomplished
by an explicit structure declaration facility, 
a restriction on the permissible operations, and execution-time checks.

A Note on the Calculation Working Set Size

Finite-length reference string of arbitrary
structure are considered, and an exact expression 
for average working set size in terms of "corrected"
interreference interval statistics is derived.  
An example is discussed; upper and lower bounds are obtained;
and the average working set size function 
is shown to be efficiently obtained for a set of page
sizes, in a single pass of the reference string. 
 This work follows the developments of a paper by Denning
and Schwartz, who consider infinite-length 
reference strings which satisfy certain statistical
properties and who derive an expression relating 
the asymptotic average working set size to the asymptotic
missing page rate function under working set 
replacement.

A Weighted Buddy Method for Dynamic Storage Allocation

An extension of the buddy method, called the weighted
buddy method, for dynamic storage allocation 
is presented.  The weighted buddy method allows block
sizes of 2^k and 3(2^k), whereas the original buddy 
method allowed only block sizes of 2^k. This extension
is achieved at an additional cost of only two 
bits per block.  Simulation results are presented which
compare this method with the buddy method.  These 
results indicate that for a uniform request distribution,
the buddy system has less total memory fragmentation 
than the weighted buddy algorithm.  However, the total
fragmentation is smaller for the weighted buddy 
method when the requests are for exponentially distributed block sizes.

Extending the Information Theory Approach to Converting
Limited-Entry Decision Tables to Computer 
Programs
.W
This paper modifies an earlier algorithm for
converting decision tables into flowcharts which 
minimize subsequent execution time when compiled into
a computer program.  The algorithms considered 
in this paper perform limited search and, accordingly,
do not necessarily result in globally optimal 
solutions.  However, the greater search effort needed
to obtain a globally optimal solution for complex 
decision tables is usually not justified by sufficient
savings in execution time.  There is an analogy 
between the problem of converting decision tables into
efficient flowcharts and the well-understood problem 
in information theory of noiseless coding.  The results
of the noiseless coding literature are used to 
explore the limitations of algorithms used to solve
the decision table problem.  The analogy between 
the two problems is also used to develop improvements
to the information algorithm in extending the depth 
of search under certain conditions and in proposing
additional conditions to be added to the decision 
table.  Finally, the information algorithm is compared
with an algorithm proposed in a recent paper by 
Verhelst.

A new integration algorithm is found, and an
implementation is compared with other programmed

for solving the initial value problem in ordinary 
differential equations.  It is designed to approximate
poles of small integer order in the solutions 
of the differential equations by continued fractions obtained
by manipulating the sums of truncated Taylor 
series expansions.  The new method is compared with
Gragg-Bulirsh-Stoer, and the Taylor series method. 
 The Taylor series method and the new method are shown
to be superior in speed and accuracy, while the 
new method is shown to be most superior when the solution
is required near a singularity.  The new method 
can finally be seen to pass automatically through singularities
where all the other methods which are

Execution Time Requirements for Encipherment Programs

Although encipherment has often been discussed
as a means to protect computer data, its costs 
are not well established.  Five experiments were conducted
a pseudo random key.  The results were analyzed 
for consistency over 100 runs, and the effects of constant
and intermittent errors were considered.  
Timing rates for assembly language encipherment ranged
from 498,800 characters per second for a pseudo 
random key cipher to 2,092,000 characters per second
for a constant one-word key cipher.  The latter 
is almost equivalent to the rate required simply to move
data without encipherment.  Fortran tests required 
over four times as much cpu time.  This paper introduces
the idea on enciphering time coefficient the 
ratio of enciphering time to the time taken to
fetch and store data without encipherment.

A User Authentication Scheme Not Requiring Secrecy in the Computer
.W
In many computer operating systems a user authenticates
himself by entering a secret password 
known solely to himself and the system.  The system compares
this password with one recorded in a Password 
Table which is available to only the authentication
program.  The integrity of the system depends on 
keeping the table secret.  In this paper a password
scheme is presented which does not require secrecy 
in the computer.    All aspects of the system, including
all relevant code and data bases, may be known 
by anyone attempting to intrude.  The scheme is based
on using a function H which the would-be intruder 
is unable to invert.  This function is applied to the
user's password and the result compared to a table 
entry, a match being interpreted as authentication of
the user.  The intruder may know all about H and 
have access to the table, but he can penetrate the system
only if he can invert H to determine an input 
that produces a given output.  This paper discusses
issues surrounding selection of a suitable H.  Two 
different plausible arguments are given that penetration
would be exceedingly difficult, and it is then 
argued that more rigorous results are unlikely.  Finally,
some human engineering problems relating to 
the scheme are discussed.

explained. These inadequacies are traced to the 
lack of an efficient absolute address for objects in
these systems.  The direct use of a capability as 
an address is shown to overcome these difficulties
because it provides the needed absolute address.  
Implementation of capability-based addressing is discussed.
 It is predicted that the use of tags to 
identify capabilities will dominate.  A hardware address
translation scheme which never requires the 
modification of the representation of capabilities is
suggested. The scheme uses a main memory hash table 
for obtaining a segment's location in main memory given
its unique code.  The hash table is avoided for
recently accessed segments by means of a set of associative
registers.  A computer using capability-based 
addressing may be substantially superior to present
systems on the basis of protection, simplicity of 
programming conventions, and efficient implementation.

Protection and the Control of Information Sharing in Multics

The design of mechanisms to control the sharing
of information in the Multics system is described. 
 Five design principles help provide insight into the
tradeoffs among different possible designs.  The 
key mechanisms described include access control lists,
hierarchical control of access specifications, 
identification and authentication of users, and primary
memory protection.  The paper ends with a discussion

Scheduling Independent Tasks to Reduce Mean Finishing Time
.W
Sequencing to minimize mean finishing time
(or mean time in system) is not only desirable to 
the user, but it also tends to minimize at each point
in time the storage required to hold incomplete 
tasks.  In this paper a deterministic model of independent
tasks is introduced and new results are derived 
which extend and generalize the algorithms known for
minimizing mean finishing time.  In addition to 
presenting and analyzing new algorithms it is shown
that the most general mean-finishing-time problem 
for independent tasks is polynomial complete, and hence unlikely
to admit of a non-enumerative solution

Minimal-Total-Processing Time Drum and Disk Scheduling Disciplines
.W
This article investigates the application of
minimal-total-processing-time (MTPT) scheduling 
disciplines to rotating storage units when random arrival
of requests is allowed.  Fixed-head drum and 
moving-head drum and moving-head disk storage units are
considered, and emphasis is placed on the relative 
merits of the MTPT scheduling discipline with respect
to the shortest-latency-time-first (SLTF) scheduling 
discipline.  The results of the simulation studies
presented show that neither scheduling discipline 
is unconditionally superior to the other.  For most
fixed-head drum applications, the SLTF discipline 
is preferable to MTPT, but for intra-cylinder disk scheduling
the MTPT discipline offers a distinct advantage 
over the SLTF discipline.  The computational requirements
of an algorithm that implements the MTPT scheduling 
discipline are shown to be comparable to SLTF algorithms.
In both cases, the sorting procedure is the 
most time-consuming phase of the algorithm.

An Information-Theoretic Approach to
Text Searching in Direct Access Systems
.W
Using direct access computer files of bibliographic
information, an attempt is made to overcome 
one of the problems often associated with information
retrieval, namely, the maintenance and use of large 
dictionaries, the greater part of which is used only
infrequently.  A novel method is presented, which 
maps the hyperbolic frequency distribution.  This is
more suited to implementation on storage devices. 
 This method treats text as a string of characters rather
than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets 
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types.  The members 
of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.
The rectangular distribution of key frequencies 
results in a much simplified file organization
and promises considerable cost advantages.

HYDRA: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System

This paper describes the design philosophy of
HYDRA-the kernel of an operating system for C.mmp,

is realized through the introduction of a 
generalized notion of "resource", both physical and virtual,
called an "object".  Mechanisms are presented 
for dealing with objects, including the creation of new
types, specification of new operations applicable 
to a given type, sharing, and protection of any reference
to a given object against improper application 
of any of the operations defined with respect to that
type of object.  The mechanisms provide a coherent 
basis for extension of the system in two directions: the
introduction of new facilities, and the creation 
of highly secure systems.

Two Languages for Estimating Program Efficiency

Two languages enabling their users to estimate

 The program whose efficiency one wishes to estimate is written

 Processors for the two languages are also

translator which compiles a program into a symbolic 
formula representing the execution time for that program.
 The sound processor is a set of procedures 
for that program.  The second processor is a set of
procedures for algebraic manipulation which can be 
called by the user to operate on the formula produced
by the first processor.  Examples of the usage

A Model for Masking Rotational Latency by Dynamic Disk Allocation

This paper presents the background and algorithms
for masking the rotational latency of a disk 
or drum.  It discusses the anticipatory input and output
of blocks of data to buffer and primary memories 
for a mono-programmed computer system.  A basic permutation
algorithm and several variations are given. 
  Because of the anticipatory nature of the I/O scheduling,
these algorithms are restricted to classes 
of programs with predictable behavior.  While the methods
are not restricted to numerical computations, 
matrix and partial differential equation methods are
typical examples of their use.  It is shown that 
latency may be masked using a small amount of buffer
memory.  The methods discussed are independent of 
the overall size of the data base being considered.

A Simple Linear Model of Demand Paging Performance

Predicting the performance of a proposed automatically
managed multilevel memory system requires 
a model of the patterns by which programs refer to the
information stored in the memory.  Some recent 
experimental measurements on the Multics virtual memory
suggest that, for rough approximations, a remarkably 
simple program reference model will suffice.  The simple
model combines the effect of the information 
reference pattern with the effect of the automatic management
algorithm to produce a single, composite 
statement: the mean number of memory references between
paging exceptions increases linearly with the 
size of the paging memory.  The resulting model is easy
to manipulate, and is applicable to such diverse 
problems as choosing an optimum size for a paging memory,
arranging for reproducible memory usage charges, 
and estimating the amount of core memory sharing.

Some Performance Tests of "quicksort" and Descendants
.W
Detailed performance evaluations are presented
for six ACM algorithms: quicksort (No. 64), 
Shellsort (No. 201), stringsort (No. 207), "TREESORT3"
402).  Algorithms 271 and 402 are refinements of algorithm
64, and all three are discussed in some detail. 
 The evidence given here demonstrates that qsort (No.
402) requires many more comparisons than its author 
claims.  Of all these algorithms, quickersort requires
the fewest comparisons to sort random arrays.

Optimal Space Allocation on Disk Storage Devices
.W
When the amount of space required for file storage
exceeds the amount which can be kept on-line, 
decisions must be made as to which files are to be permanently
resident and which mountable.  These decisions 
will affect the number of mount requests issued to the
operators.  This is often a bottleneck in a computing 
facility, and reducing the number of mounts thus decreases
turnaround time.  An optimization model for 
the assignment of files to disk packs, and packs to either
resident or nonresident status is presented. 
 Heuristics are suggested for those cases in which
it is inefficient to compute the actual optimum.

On the Construction of a Representative Synthetic Workload

A general method of constructing a drive workload
representative of a real workload is described. 
The real workload is characterized by its demands on the
various system resources.  These characteristics 
of the real workload are obtained from the system accounting
data. The characteristics of the drive workload 
are determined by matching the joint probability density
of the real workload with that of the drive 
workload.  The drive workload is realized by using a
synthetic program in which the characteristics can

The Synthesis of Loop Predicates

Current methods for mechanical program verification
require a complete predicate specification 
on each loop.  Because this is tedious and error prone,
producing a program with complete, correct predicates 
is reasonably difficult and would be facilitated by machine
assistance.  This paper discusses techniques 
for mechanically synthesizing loop predicates.  Two classes
of techniques are considered: (1) heuristic 
methods which derive loop predicates from boundary conditions
and/or partially specified inductive assertions: 
(2) extraction methods which use input predicates and
appropriate weak interpretations to obtain certain 
classes of loop predicates by an evaluation on the weak interpretation.

Production Systems: or Can We Do Better than BNF?
.W
Since the development of BNF, the definition
of the syntax of programming languages has been 
almost universally associated with context-free requirements.
 Yet numerous interesting and difficult 
issues in syntax stem from the context-sensitive requirements,
notably the compatibility between the 
declaration of an identifier and its uses, the correspondence
between actual and formal parameters, and 
issues arising from block structure.  This paper explores
the use of a formal notation called Production 
Systems in providing a readable and complete formal definition
of syntax.  As a practical illustration, 
a small but significant subset of PL/I is considered.  A
more detailed presentation, as well as the application 
to define abstract syntax and translations between languages,
is given in a previous paper by the author.

"real time" character generators have previously 
been limited to alphanumeric characters.  A display is
described which extends the capabilities of this

of such a display is shown by deriving the 
minimum number of patterns required in the read only
memory of the character generator to synthesize 
an arbitrary line.  The synthesis process does not compromise
picture quality since the resulting dot 
patterns are identical with those of a conventional
raster display.  Furthermore, the time constraints

Attribute Based File Organization in a Paged Memory Environment

The high cost of page accessing implies a need
for more careful data organization in a paged 
memory than is typical of most inverted file and similar
approaches to multi-key retrieval.  This article 
analyses that cost and proposes a method called multiple
key hashing which attempts to minimize it.  
Since this approach is not always preferable to inversion,
a combined method is described.  The exact 
specifications of this combination for a file with given
data and traffic characteristics is formulated 
as a mathematical program.  The proposed heuristic solution
to this program can often improve on a simple 
inversion technique by a factor of 2 or 3.

A new family of clipping algorithms is described.
 These algorithms are able to clip polygons 
against irregular convex plane-faced volumes in three
dimensions, removing the parts of the polygon which 
lie outside the volume.  In two dimensions the algorithms
permit clipping against irregular convex windows. 
 Polygons to be clipped are represented as an ordered
sequence of vertices without repetition of first 
and last, in marked contrast to representation as a
collection of edges as was heretofore the common 
procedure.  Output polygons have an identical format,
with new vertices introduced in sequence to describe 
any newly-cut edge or edges.  The algorithms easily handle
the particularly difficult problem of detecting 
that a new vertex may be required at a corner of the
clipping window.  The algorithms described achieve 
considerable simplicity by clipping separately against
stage is ready.  Because the same code is reentered 
for clipping against subsequent boundaries, clipping
against very complex window shapes is practical. 
 For perspective applications in three dimentions, a six-plane
truncated pyramid is chosen as the clipping 
volume.  The two additional planes parallel to the projection
screen serve to limit the range of depth 
preserved through the projection.  A perspective projection
method which provides for arbitrary view 
angles and depth of field in spite of simple fixed clipping
planes is described.  This method is ideal 
for subsequent hidden-surface computations.

Tridiagonalization by Permutations
.W
Tridiagonalizing a matrix by similarity transformations
is an important computational tool 
only row and corresponding column permutations.  The
advantages of using such a transformation include 
the absence of round-off errors and improved computation time
when compared with standard transformations. 
 A graph theoretic algorithm which examines an arbitrary
n x n matrix and determines whether or not it 
can be permuted into tridiagonal form is given.  The
algorithm requires no arithmetic while the number 
of comparisons, the number of assignments, and the number
of increments are linear in n.  This compares 
very favorably with standard transformation methods.
 If the matrix is permutable into tridiagonal form, 
the algorithm gives the explicit tridiagonal form.
 Otherwise, early rejection will occur.

A Fast Method for Solving a Class of Tridiagonal Linear Systems
.W
The solution of linear systems having real, symmetric,
diagonally dominant,tridiagonal coefficient 
matrices with constant diagonals is considered.  It is
proved that the diagonals of the LU decomposition 
converges when floating-point precision.  It is also
proved that the computed LU decomposition converges 
when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the limits
of the LU diagonals using floating point are 
roughly within machine precision of the limits using
real arithmetic.  This fact is exploited to reduce 
the number of floating-point operations required to
solve a linear system from 8n-7 to 5n+2k-3, where 
k is much less than n, the order of the matrix.  If the
elements of the subdiagonals and superdiagonals 
are 1, then only 4n+2k-3 operations are needed.  The
entire LU decomposition takes k words of storage, 
and considerable savings in array subscripting are achieved.
 Upper and lower bounds on k are obtained 
in terms of the ratio of the coefficient matrix diagonal
constants and parameters of the floating-point 
number system.  Various generalizations of these results are discussed.

 It is also shown that in programming terms,

On the Complexity of LR(k) Testing

The problem of determining whether an arbitrary

is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed
integer and when k is considered to be a parameter 
of the test.  In the first case, it is shown that for
every k there exists an O(n(k+2)) algorithm for 
testing the LR(k) property, where n is the size of the
grammar in question.  On the other hand, if both 
k and the subject grammar are problem parameters, then
the complexity of the problem depends very strongly 
on the representation chosen for k.  More specifically,
when k is expressed in unary.  When k is expressed in
binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic 
exponential time.  These results carry over to many

environment where stored entities (documents) 
are compared with each other or with incoming patterns

the value of an indexing system may be expressible
as a function of the density of the object space; 
in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely
with space density.  An approach based on

indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. 
 Typical evaluation results are shown, demonstrating

Consider two linearly ordered sets A, B, |A|=m,
|B|=n, m<=n, and p, p<=m, parallel processors 
working synchronously.  The paper presents an algorithm
for merging A and B with the p parallel processors, 
which requires at most 2[log2 (2m+1)]+[3m/p] + [m/p][log2
(n/m)] steps.  If n = (2^B)m (B an integer), 
the algorithm requires at most 2[log2 (m+1)] + [m/p](2+B)
steps.  In the case where m and n are of the 
same order of magnitude, i.e. n=km with k being a constant,
the algorithm requires 2[log2 (m+1)] + [m/p](3+k) 
steps.  These performances compare very favorably with
the previous best parallel merging algorithm, 
Batcher's algorithm, which requires n/p + ((m+n)/2p)log2 m

CONVERT: A High Level Translation
.W
This paper describes a high level and nonprocedural
translation definition language, CONVERT, 
which provides very powerful and highly flexible data
restructuring capabilities. Its design is based 
on the simple underlying concept of a form which enables
the users to visualize the translation processes, 
and thus makes data translation a much simpler task. 
"CONVERT" has been chosen for conveying the purpose 
of the language and should not be confused with any
other language or program bearing the same name.

A Preliminary System for the Design of DBTG Data Structures
.W
The functional approach to database design is
introduced.  In this approach the goal of design 
is to derive a data structure which is capable of supporting
a set of anticipated queries rather than 
a structure which "models the business" in some other
way. An operational computer program is described 
which utilizers the functional approach to design data
structures conforming to the Data Base Task Group 
specifications.  The automatic programming technology
utilized by this program, although typically used 
to generate procedure, is here used to generate declaratives.

One means of analyzing program performance
is by deriving closed-form expressions for their

for their running time expressed in terms of size of input.
 This paper presents the reasons for mechanizing

Optimal Balancing of I/O Requests to Disks
.W
Determining a policy for efficient allocation
and utilization of a set of disk drives with 
differing operational characteristics is examined using
analytical techniques.  Using standard queueing 
theory, each disk drive is characterized by a queueing
model with service time of a disk drive represented 
by the probability density function of the sum of two
uniform distributions. Total response time of the 
set of disk models is then minimized under varying
load conditions. The results indicate that faster 
devices should have higher utilization factors and that
the number of different device types utilized 
tends to decrease with decreasing load.  Specific examples
using 2314 and 3330 combinations are examined.

The Digital Simulation of River Plankton Population Dynamics

This paper deals with the development of a
mathematical model for and the digital simulation 
in Fortran IV of phytoplankton and zooplankton population
densities in a river using previously developed 
rate expressions.  In order to study the relationships
between the ecological mechanisms involved, the 
simulation parameters were varied illustrating the
response of the ecosystem to different conditions, 
including those corresponding to certain types of chemical
and thermal pollution.  As an investigation 
of the accuracy of the simulation methods, a simulation

accurate, the simulation was found to predict the general
annual pattern of plankton growth fairly well 
and, specifically, revealed the importance of the annual
velocity cycle in determining such patterns. 
 In addition, the study demonstrates the usefulness of
digital simulations in the examinations of certain 
aquatic ecosystems, as well as in environmental

Multidimensional Binary Search Trees Used for Associative Searching
.W
This paper develops the multidimensional binary
search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality 
of the search space) as a data structure for storage of
information to be retrieved by associative searches. 
The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It
is shown to be quite in its storage requirements. 
 A significant advantage of this structure is that a single
data structure can handle many types of queries 
very efficiently.  Various utility algorithms are developed;
their proven average running times in an 
n record file are: insertion, O (log n); deletion of
the root, O (n^(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, 
O (log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance
of searches), O (n log n).  Search algorithms 
are given for partial match queries with t keys specified
[proven maximum running time of O (n^(k-t)/k)] 
and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average
running time of O (log n).]  These performances 
far surpass the best currently known algorithms for
these tasks.  An algorithm is presented to handle 
any general intersection query. The main focus of this
paper theoretical.  It is felt, however, that 
k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications,
and examples of potential uses are given.

 (This often improves the clarity of the decision table

 Objective (1) is also attained if overspecified

On the External Storage Fragmentation Produced
by First-Fit and Best-Fit Allocation Strategies
.W
Published comparisons of the external fragmentation
produced by first-fit and best-fit memory 
allocation have not been consistent.  Through simulation,
a series of experiments were performed in order 
to obtain better data on the relative performance of
first-fit and best-fit and a better understanding 
of the reasons underlying observed differences. The
time-memory-product efficiencies of first-fit and 
best-fit were generally within 1 to 3 percent of each
other.  Except for small populations, the size 
of the request population had little effect on allocation
efficiency.  For exponential and hyperexponential 
distributions of requests, first-fit outperformed best-fit;
but for normal and uniform distributions, 
and for exponential distributions distorted in various
ways, best-fit outperformed first-fit.  It is 
hypothesized that when first-fit outperforms best-fit,
it does so because first-fit, by preferentially 
allocating toward one end of memory, encourages large blocks
to grow at the other end.  Sufficient contiguous 
space is thereby more likely to be available for relatively
large requests.  Results of simulation experiments 
supported this hypothesis and showed that the relative
performance of first-fit and best-fit depends 
on the frequency of request.  When the coefficient of
variation of the request distribution is greater 
than or approximately equal to unity, first-fit outperformed best-fit.

This paper describes a method for finding the
rectangle of minimum area in which a given arbitrary 
plane curve can be contained.  The method is of interest
in certain packing and optimum layout problems. 
 It consists of first determining the minimal-perimeter
convex polygon that encloses the given curve 
and then selecting the rectangle of minimum area capable
of containing this polygon.  Three theorems 
are introduced to show that one side of the minimum-area
rectangle must be colinear with an edge of the

for the convex polygon is also the minimum-area 
rectangle for the curve.

Over the past few years, a number of systems
for the computer analysis of natural language 
sentences have been based on augmented context-free
grammars: a context-free grammar which defines a

to which a tree must conform in order 
to be a valid sentence analysis.  As the coverage of the
grammar is increased, an efficient representation 
becomes essential for further development.  This paper
presents a programming language designed specifically 
for the compact and perspicuous statement of restrictions
of a natural language grammar.  It is based 
on ten years' experience parsing text sentences with

Improved Event-Scanning Mechanisms for Discrete Event Simulation

Simulation models of large, complex "real-world"
applications have occasionally earned the 
reputation of eating up hours of computer time.  This

in their proper sequence.  This paper presents 
a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanning
future event lists in discrete event simulations. 
 There models are presented, all of which improve in effectiveness

The model aids in choosing between the two simulation

A Cost Oriented Algorithm for Data Set Allocation in Storage Hierarchies
.W
Data set allocation in today's multilevel
storage systems is usually based on qualitative, 
ad hoc decisions.  While it would be desirable to obtain
an optimal solution to this allocation problem, 
it is clear that the number of parameters involved makes
it intractable to straight-forward solution. 
 In such a situation, we must find a set of assumptions
which simplify the problem greatly, but which 
still provide a basis for considering all significant
cost elements. This paper presents such a first, 
quantitative allocation step.  It considers many of the
significant detailed costs of system utilization, 
data storage, data staging, and data migration.  Although
many avenues of further improvement are available, 
the present algorithm seems to be usefully accurate.
As such, it can aid in quantifying the problems 
of data set allocation, storage system configuration, and new device designs.

 Several shading techniques corresponding to different

A Heuristic Problem Solving Design System
for Equipment or Furniture Layouts
.W
The Designer Problem Solver (DPS) demonstrates
that the computer can perform simple design 
tasks.  In particular, it designs furniture and equipment
layouts.  This task was chosen because it is 
simple, well defined, and characteristic of many design
tasks in architecture, engineering, urban planning, 
and natural resource management.  These space planning
tasks usually involve manipulating two-dimensional 
representations of objects to create feasible or optimal
solutions for problems involving topological 
and metric spatial constraints.  The paper describes
extensive tests performed on the program.  DPS is 
a heuristic problem solver with a planning phase prefixed
to it.  It uses the planning process to give 
it a sense of direction, diagnostic procedures to locate
difficulties, and remedial actions to recover 
from difficulties.  It uses a convex polygon representation
to accurately describe the objects and the 
layout.  This representation allows topological and
metric constraints to be tested and the design to 
be easily updated.  DPS has been applied to 50 problems.
 While it is slow and limited in scope, the 
ideas behind it are general.  It demonstrates the need
for selectivity in controlling search and the 
methods used to achieve it: task-specific information,
planning, diagnostic procedures, remedial actions, 
and selective alternative generators.

Analysis and performance of Inverted Data Base Structures
.W
The need to envision and architecture data base
systems in a hierarchical level by level framework 
is stressed. The inverted data base (file) organization
is then analyzed, considering implementation 
oriented aspects.  The inverted directory is viewed realistically
as another large data base which itself 
is subjected to inversion.  Formulations are derived
to estimate average access time (read only) and 
storage requirements, formalizing the interaction of data
base content characteristics, logical complexity 
of queries, and machine timing and blocking specifications
identified as having a first-order effect 
on performance.  The formulations presented are necessary
to be used in conjunction with any index selection 
criteria to determine the optimum set of index keys.

Copying Cyclic List Structures in Linear Time Using Bounded Workspace

operates in linear time and does not require tag bits. 
The best previous bounded workspace copying algorithms 
achieved n^2 time without tag bits and n log n time with
one tag.  The only restriction on the algorithm 
given here is that the copy must be placed into a contiguous

A Comparison of Simulation Event List Algorithms

Four algorithms are considered which can be used
to schedule events in a general purpose discrete 
simulation system.  Two of the algorithms are new, one
is based on an end-order tree structure for event 
notices, and another uses an indexed linear list. The algorithms
are tested with a set of typical stochastic 
scheduling distributions especially chosen to show
the advantages and limitations of the algorithms. 
 The end-order tree algorithm is shown to be an advantageous,
immediate replacement for the algorithm 
in use with current simulation languages.  The most
promising algorithm uses the indexed list concept. 
 It will require an adaptive routine before it can
be employed in general purpose simulators,but its 
performance is such that further study would be fruitful.

added together or subtracted.  Two algorithms to

the technique has the advantage that operations

A System for Typesetting Mathematics
.W
This paper describes the design and implementation
of a system for typesetting mathematics. 
 The language has been designed to be easy to learn
and to use by people (for example, secretaries and 
mathematical typists) who know neither mathematics nor
typesetting.  Experience indicates that the language 
can be learned in an hour or so, for it has few rules
and fewer exceptions.  For typical expressions, 
the size and font changes, positioning, line drawing, and
the like necessary to print according to mathematical 
conventions are all done automatically.  For example,
the input sum from i=o to infinity x sub i=pi over 
2 produces (formula).  The syntax of the language is specified
by a small context-free grammar; a compiler-compiler 
is used to make a compiler that translates this language
into typesetting commands.  Output maybe produced 
on either a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward
and reverse half-line motions.  The system 
interfaces directly with text formatting programs, so
mixtures of text and mathematics may be handled 
simply.  This paper was typeset by the authors using the system described

of his choice.  Practical tests of the method have

Structured programming has proved to be an important
methodology for systematic program design

as compound function expressions in the algebra 
of functions. The algebraic properties of these function
expressions permit the reformulation (expansion 
as well as reduction) of a nested subexpression independently
of its environment, thus modeling what 
is known as stepwise program refinement as well as program
execution.  Finally, structured programming 
is characterized in terms of the selection and solution
of certain elementary equations defined in the 
algebra of functions.  These solutions can be given in
general formulas, each involving a single parameter, 
which display the entire freedom available

Computer-Aided Analysis and Design of Information Systems
.W
This paper describes the use of computer-aided
analysis for the design and development of an 
Command Support Activity (NMCSA).  Computer-aided 
analysis consists of a set of procedures and computer
programs specifically designed to aid in the process 
of applications software design, computer selection
and performance evaluation.  There are four major 
components: Problem Statement Language, Problem Statement
Analyzer, Generator of Alternative Designs, 
and Performance Evaluator. The statement of requirements
was written in ADS (Accurately Defined Systems) 
and analyzed by a Problem Statement Analyzer for ADS.
 The ADS problem definition was supplemented with 
additional information in order to create a complete
problem definition.  The analyzed problem statement 
was translated to the form necessary for use by the
SODA (Systems Optimization and Design Algorithm)
program for the generation of alternative specifications
of program modules and logical database structures.

Optimal Reorganization of Distributed Space Disk Files
.W
In most database organizations, the cost of accessing
the database will increase due to structural 
changes caused by updates and insertions.  By reorganizing
the database,the access costs can be reduced. 
 A basic problem is to establish the proper tradeoff between
performance, storage costs, and reorganization 
costs.  This paper considers the optimum points at which
to reorganize a database.  A disk file organization 
which allows for distributed free space is described.
 A cost function describing the excess costs due 
to physical disorganization is defined, and this function
is minimized to obtain the optimum reorganization

In database systems, users access shared data
under the assumption that the data satisfies 
certain consistency constraints.  This paper defines the
concepts of transaction, consistency and schedule 
and shows that consistency requires that a transaction
cannot request new locks after releasing a lock. 
 Then it is argued that a transaction needs to lock a logical
rather than a physical subset of the database. 
 These subsets may be specified by predicates.  An
implementation of predicate locks which satisfies 
the consistency condition is suggested.

Experiments in Text File Compression
.W
A system for the compression of data files,
viewed as strings of characters, is presented. 
 The method is general, and applies equally well to
English, to PL/I, or to digital data.  The system 
consists of an encoder, an analysis program, and a decoder.
  Two algorithms for encoding a string differ 
slightly from earlier proposals.  The analysis program attempts
to find an optimal set of codes for representing 
substrings of the file.  Four new algorithms for this
operation are described and compared.  Various 
parameters in the algorithms are optimized to obtain
a high degree of compression for sample texts.

The Design and Implementation of a Table Driven,

CAPS is a highly interactive diagnostic compiler/interpreter
that allows beginning programmers 
to prepare, debug, and execute fairly simple programs

 The most remarkable feature of CAPS is its ability 
to automatically diagnose errors both at compile time
and at run time.  Errors are not automatically 
corrected.  Instead, CAPS interacts with the student to help
him find the cause of his error.  Most components 
of CAPS are table driven, both to reduce the space needed
for implementation and to increase the flexibility 
of the multilingual system.  Over 500 students have used
CAPS to learn Fortran, PL/I, or Cobolin conjunction 
with a computer assisted course on introductory computer science.

Interactive Skeleton Techniques for Enhancing
Motion Dynamics in Key Frame Animation
.W
A significant increase in the capability for
controlling motion dynamics in key frame animation 
is achieved through skeleton control.  This technique
allows an animator to develop a complex motion 
sequence by animating a stick figure representation
of an image.  This control sequence is then used 
to drive an image sequence through the same movement.
 The simplicity of the stick figure image encourages 
a high level of interaction during the design stage. 
Its compatibility with the basic key frame animation 
technique permits skeleton control to be applied selectively
to only those components of a composite 
image sequence that require enhancement.

A Parametric Algorithm for Drawing Pictures
.W
An algorithm for drawing pictures of three-dimensional
objects, with surfaces made up of patches 
of quadric surfaces, is described.  The emphasis of
this algorithm is on calculating the intersections 
of quadric surfaces. A parameterization scheme is used.
 Each quadric surface intersection curve (QSIC) 
is represented as a set of coefficients and parameter
limits.  Each value of the parameter represents 
at most two points, and these may easily be distinguished.
 This scheme can find the coordinates of points 
of even quartic (fourth-order) intersection curves, using
equations of no more than second order.  Methods 
of parameterization for each type of OSIC are discussed,
as well as surface bounding and hidden surface 
removal.

Hierarchical Geometric Models for Visible Surface Algorithms
.W
The geometric structure inherent in the definition
of the shapes of three-dimensional objects 
and environments is used not just to define their relative
motion and placement, but also to assist in 
solving many other problems of systems for producing
pictures by computer.  By using an extension of 
traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy,
five significant improvements to current 
techniques are possible.  First, the range of complexity
of an environment is greatly increased while 
the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within
a fixed upper limit.  Second, a meaningful way 
is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in
a scene.  Third, "clipping" becomes a very fast 
logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment
within the field of view.  Fourth, frame 
to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical
"working set," or fraction of the total structure 
that should be present in primary store for immediate
access by the visible surface algorithm.  Finally, 
the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent,
visible surface algorithm in which the computation 
time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene.

Texture and Reflection in Computer Generated Images
.W
 This paper describes extensions of this algorithm in
the areas of texture simulation and lighting models. 
 The parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate
system which is used as a key for mapping patterns 
onto the surface.  The intensity of the pattern at each
picture element is computed as a weighted average 
of regions of the pattern definition function. The shape
and size of this weighting function are chosen 
using digital signal processing theory.  The patch rendering
algorithm allows accurate computation of 
the surface normal to the patch at each picture element,
permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections. 
 The amount of light coming from a given direction is
modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping 
and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture
mapping.  Several examples of images synthesized 
using these new techniques are included.

Faster Retrieval from Context Trees (Corrigendum)
.W
Context trees provide a convenient way of
storing data which is to be viewed as a hierarchy 
of contexts.  This note presents an algorithm which improves
on previous context tree retrieval algorithms. 
It is based on the observation that in typical uses context
changes are infrequent relative to retrievals, 
so that data can be cached to speed up retrieval.  A retrieval
is started from the position of the previous 
retrieval and auxiliary structures are built up to make
the search rapid.  Algorithms for addition and 
deletion of data and for garbage collection are outlined.

An Efficient, Incremental, Automatic Garbage Collector
.W
This paper describes a new way of solving
the storage reclamation problem for a system such 
as Lisp that allocates storage automatically from a
heap, and does not require the programmer to give 
any indication that particular items are no longer useful
or accessible.  A reference count scheme for 
reclaiming non-self-referential structures, and a linearizing,
compacting, copying scheme to reorganize 
all storage at the users discretion are proposed.  The
algorithms are designed to work well in systems 
which use multiple levels of storage, and large virtual
address space.  They depend on the fact that 
most cells are referenced exactly once, and that reference
counts need only be accurate when storage 
is about to be reclaimed.  A transaction file stores changes
to reference counts, and a multiple reference 
table stores the count for items which are referenced more than once.

Analysis of an Algorithm for Real Time Garbage Collection

A real time garbage collection system avoids
suspending the operations of a list processor 
for the long times that garbage collection normally requires
by performing garbage collection on a second 
processor in parallel with list processing operations,
or on a single processor time-shared with them. 
 Algorithms for recovering discarded list structures in
this manner are presented and analyzed to determine 
sufficient conditions under which the list processor never
needs to wait on the collector.  These techniques 
are shown to require at most twice as much processing
power as regular garbage collectors, if they are 
used efficiently.  The average behavior of the program
is shown to be very nearly equal to the worst-case 
performance, so that the sufficient conditions are also
suitable for measuring the typical behavior of 
the algorithm.

nodes in a trie have to be large enough to hold 
only one bit long.  In the analysis part of the 
paper it will be shown that for a collection of n keys the
retrieval time, measured in terms of bit inspections 
of one key, is of the order logm(n) and the storage
requirement of the order n*(m+log2 n) bits.  This 
improvement in storage requirements and retrieval time
is achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility

Formal Verification of Parallel Programs
.W
Two formal models for parallel computation
are presented: an abstract conceptual model and 
a parallel-program model.  The former model does not
distinguish between control and data states.  The 
latter model includes the capability for the representation
of an infinite set of control states by allowing 
there to be arbitrarily many instruction pointers (or
processes) executing the program.  An induction 
principle is presented which treats the control and
data state sets on the same ground.  Through the 
use of "place variables," it is observed that certain
correctness conditions can be expressed without 
enumeration of the set of all possible control states.
 Examples are presented in which the induction 
principle is used to demonstrate proofs of mutual exclusion.
 It is shown that assertions-oriented proof 
methods are special cases of the induction principle.
A special case of the assertions method, which 
is called parallel place assertions, is shown to be
incomplete.  A formalization of "deadlock" is then 
presented. The concept of a "norm" is introduced, which
yields an extension, to the deadlock problem, 
of Floyd's technique for proving termination.  Also discussed
is an extension of the program model which 
allows each process to have its own local variables
 An Appendix is included which relates this work 
to previous work on the satisfiability of certain logical formulas.

An efficient algorithm is presented for moving
arbitrary list structures, using no storage

The Synthetic Approach to Decision Table Conversion
.W
Previous approaches to the problem of automatically
converting decision tables to computer 
programs have been based on decomposition.  At any
stage, one condition is selected for testing, and 
two smaller problems (decision tables with one less
condition) are created.  An optimal program (with 
respect to average execution time or storage space, for
example) is located only through implicit enumeration 
of all possible decision trees using a technique such
as branch-and-bound.  The new approach described 
in this paper uses dynamic programming to synthesize
an optimal decision tree from which a program can 
be created.  Using this approach, the efficiency of creating
an optimal program is increased substantially, 
permitting generation of optimal programs for decision
tables with as many as ten to twelve conditions.

Referencing Lists by an Edge

An edge reference into a list structure is a pair
of pointers to adjacent nodes.  Such a reference 
often requires little additional space, but its use can
yield efficient algorithms. For instance, a circular 
link between the ends of a list is redundant if the list
is always referenced by that edge, and list traversal 
is easier when that link is null.  Edge references also
allow threading of nonrecursive lists, can replace 
some header cells, and enhance the famous
exclusive-or-trick to double-link lists

A Process for the Determination of
Addresses in Variable Length Addressing

An algorithm is presented for the assignment
of instruction addresses and formats under the 
following conditions: (1) the length of the instruction varies
as a function of the distance of the instruction 
from its target; (2) there exists an optimality criterion
which implies some preferential choices subject 
to the addressing constraints.  This may be, for example,
achieving the smallest number of long instructions, 
in which case the total code length is minimized, or
minimizing the assigned address of a specified point 
in the program.  The algorithm is suitable for arbitrary
program structure and a choice of optimization 
criteria.

value is derived for the relative degree of memory interference
as the system size increases.  The model 
of the limiting behavior of the system yields approximate
results for the simple model and also suggests 
that the results are valid for a much larger class of models,
including those more nearly like real systems 
that the simple model are tested against some measurements
of program behavior and simulations of systems 
using memory references from real programs.  The model
results provide a good indication of the performance 
that should be expected from real system of this type.

Analysis of the PFF Replacement Algorithm via a Semi-Markov Model
.W
An analytical model is presented to estimate
the performance of the Page Fault Frequency (PFF) 
replacement algorithm.  In this model, program behavior
is represented by the LRU stack distance model 
and the PFF replacement algorithm is represented by a semi-Markov
model.  Using these models, such parameters 
as the inter-page-fault interval distribution, the
probability of the number of distinct pages being 
referenced during an inter-page-fault interval, etc. are
able to be analytically determined.  Using these 
models to evaluate these parameter values permits study
of the performance of the replacement algorithm 
by simulating the page fault events rather than every
page reference event.  This significantly reduces 
the required computation time in estimating
the performance of the PFF algorithm.

Characteristics of Program Localities
.W
The term "locality" has been used to denote that
subset of a program's segments which are referenced 
during a particular phase of its execution.  A program's
behavior can be characterized in terms of its 
residence in localities of various sizes and lifetimes,
and the transitions between these localities. 
 In this paper the concept of a locality is made more explicit
through a formal definition of what constitutes 
a phase of localized reference behavior, and by a corresponding
mechanism for the detection of localities 
in actual reference strings.  This definition provides
for the existence of a hierarchy of localities 
at any given time, and the reasonableness of the definition
is supported by examples taken from actual 
programs.  Empirical data from a sample of production
Algol 60 programs is used to display distributions 
of locality sizes and lifetimes, and these results are
discussed in terms of their implications for the 
modeling of program behavior and memory management in virtual memory systems.

Hoare has given a set of axioms for partial correctness,

 This paper defines a more powerful deductive system which
is in some sense complete for partial correctness. 
 A crucial axiom provides for the use of auxiliary variables,
which are added to a parallel program as 
an aid to proving it correct.  The information in a partial
correctness proof can be used to prove such 
properties as mutual exclusion, freedom from deadlock,
and program termination.  Techniques for verifying 
these properties are presented and illustrated by
application to the dining philosophers problem.

A Lattice Model of Secure Information Flow

This paper investigates mechanisms that guarantee
secure information flow in a computer system. 
These mechanisms are examined within a mathematical framework
suitable for formulating the requirements 
of secure information flow among security classes. The
central component of the model is a lattice structure 
derived from the security classes and justified by the semantics
of information flow.  The lattice properties 
permit concise formulations of the security requirements
of different existing systems and facilitate 
the construction of mechanisms that enforce security.
 The model provides a unifying view of all systems 
that restrict information flow, enables a classification
of them according to security objectives, and 
suggests some new approaches.  It also leads to the construction
of automatic program certification mechanisms 
for verifying the secure flow of information through a program.

Most present systems for verification of computer
programs are incomplete in that intermediate 
inductive assertions must be provided manually by the

these problems, this paper suggests conducting a 
logical analysis of programs by using invariants which
express what is actually occurring in the program. 
 The first part of the paper is devoted to techniques
for the automatic generation of invariants.  The 
second part provides criteria for using the invariants
to check simultaneously for correctness (including 
termination) or incorrectness.  A third part examines
the implications of the approach for the automatic 
diagnosis and correction of logical errors.

Intentional Resolution of Privacy Protection in Database Systems
.W
Traditionally, privacy protection in database
systems is understood to be the control over 
what information a given user can get from a database.
 This paper is concerned with another, independent, 
dimension of privacy protection, the control over what
a user is allowed to do with a piece of information 
supplied to him by the database.  The ability to condition
the supply of information on its intended 
use is called here "intentional resolution" of privacy
protection.  The practical importance of intentional 
resolution is demonstrated by several examples, and its realization
is discussed.  It is shown that intentional 
resolution can be achieved, but that it involves a radical
change from the traditional approach to the 
process of user-database interaction.  In particular,
it appears to be necessary for the database to 
impose a certain amount of control over the internal
behavior of users' programs which interact with 
it.  A model for user-database interaction
which admits such a control is developed.

policy is one of arriving users who may join the system

with a single control number for any possible queue

join a queue that is not filled up to the control number
corresponding to this queue and the user's class. 
 In this paper control numbers, as well as lower and upper

An Application of Heuristic Search Methods to Edge and Contour Detection

This paper presents a method for detecting edges
and contours in noisy pictures.  The properties 
of an edge are embedded in a figure of merit and the edge
detection problem becomes the problem of minimizing 
the given figure of merit.  This problem can be represented
as a shortest path problem on a graph and 
can be solved using well-known graph search algorithms.
 The relations between this representation of 
the minimization problem and a dynamic programming approach
are discussed, showing that the graph search 
method can lead to substantial improvements in computing
time.  Moreover, if heuristic search methods 
are used, the computing time will depend on the amount
of noise in the picture.  Some experimental results 
are given; these show how various information about the
shape of the contour of an object can be embedded
in the figure of merit, thus allowing the extraction
of contours from noisy picture and the separation

Performance of Height-Balanced Trees

This paper presents the results of simulations
that investigate the performance of height-balanced 
(HB[k]) trees.  It is shown that the only statistic
of HB[1] trees (AVL trees) that is a function of 
the size of the tree is the time to search for an item
in the tree.  For sufficiently large trees, the 
execution times of all procedures for maintaining HB[1]
trees are independent of the size of the tree. 
 In particular, an average of .465 restructures are required
per insertion, with an average of 2.78 nodes 
revisited to restore the HB[1] property; an average of
 .214 restructures are required per deletion, with 
an average of 1.91 nodes revisited to restore the HB[1]
property.  Moreover,the execution times of procedures 
for maintaining HB[k] trees, for k>1, are also independent
of the size of the tree except for the average 
number of nodes revisited on a delete operation in
order to restore the HB[k] property on trace back. 
 The cost of maintaining HB[k] trees drops sharply as the
allowable imbalance (k) increases.  Both analytical 
and experimental results that show the cost of maintaining
HB[k] trees as a function of k are discussed.

On Quadratic Adaptive Routing Algorithms
.W
Two analytic models of a store-and-forward communications
network are constructed, one to find 
the optimal message routing and the other to illustrate
the equilibrium (stationary state) maintained 
by an adaptive routing algorithm.  These models show that
adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary 
conditions for an optimal routing,  Adaptive routing tends
to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate 
routes because it does not consider the impact of its
current routing decision on the future state of 
the network.  The form of the optimality conditions suggests
that a modification of the adaptive algorithm 
will result in optimality.  The modification requires
the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead 
of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each
network node.  Simulation results are presented

Computers as an Innovation in American Local Governments
.W
Computers and electronic data processing are
a major technological innovation in the operations 
of American local government. This paper establishes that
there is substantial variation among the larger 
local governments in the rate at which they adopt computer
technology, in the level of financial support 
they provide for EDP, and in the extensiveness and sophistication
of their automated applications.  The 
central question addressed is: What might explain the
differences between governments in the extent to 
which they adopt and use computers?  Hypotheses are
tested for several streams of explanatory factors, 
using data from more than 500 city and county governments.
 The findings identify certain local government 
milieus which are particularly conducive to higher levels
of computer innovation.  Somewhat unexpected 
findings reveal the significant impact of the distribution
of control over EDP decisions and the dominant 
political values within the government. Other important
factors include the measured need for computer 
applications and the presence of external funding support
for computing.  Finally, the paper suggests 
a framework for identifying the key determinants
of other technological innovations.

A Case Study of a New Code Generation Technique for Compilers
.W
Recent developments in optimizing techniques
have allowed a new design for compilers to emerge. 
 Such a compiler translates the parsed source code into
lower level code by a sequence of steps.  Each 
step expands higher level statements into blocks of
lower level code and then performs optimizations 
on the result.  Each statement has only one possible
expansion-the task of tailoring this code to take 
advantage of any special cases is done by the optimizations.
 This paper provides evidence that this 
strategy can indeed result in good object code.  The
traditionally difficult PL/I concatenate statement 
was investigated as a detailed example.  A set of fairly
simple optimizations was identified which allow 
the compiler to produce good code. More elaborate optimizations
can further improve the object code. 
 For most contexts of the concatenate statement, the code
produced by a compiler using the expansion-optimization 
strategy described above compares favorably with the
code produced by a conventional PL/I optimizing 
compiler.

A sequential programming language forces the
programmer to prescribe explicitly the order in 
which the operations in his program have to be executed,
even if the order is not relevant to the solution 
of his problem.  The requirement to indicate irrelevant
sequencing can be removed if the language provides 
facilities for specifying a task in a nonprocedural
manner.  In general, a program specified in this 
way will allow concurrent evaluation.  This paper describes
a conceptual framework for a high level programming 
language providing both nonprocedural and sequential
facilities.  Within a program, nonprocedural and 
sequential program modules may be nested freely.

the encoded string, and one sequence of strings 
precedes another if and only if the encoding of the first
precedes the encoding of the second.  The strings 
may be variable length, without a maximum length restriction,
and no symbols need be reserved for control 
purposes.  Hence any symbol may occur in any string.  The
scheme is useful for multifield sorting, multifield

terms of processing time, memory usage, and external memory

tended to perform quite well compared with other 
algorithms.  Simple algorithms operating on memory ordered
lists (without any free list) performed surprisingly

Perfect Hashing Functions: A Single
Probe Retrieving Method for Static Sets
.W
A refinement of hashing which allows retrieval
of an item in a static table with a single probe 
is considered.  Given a set I of identifiers, two methods
are presented for building, in a mechanical 
way, perfect hashing functions, i.e. functions transforming
the elements of I into unique addresses. 
 The first method, the "quotient reduction" method, is
shown to be complete in the sense that for every 
set I the smallest table in which the elements of I
can be stored and from which they can be retrieved 
by using a perfect hashing function constructed by this
method can be found.  However, for nonuniformly 
distributed sets, this method can give rather sparse tables.
 The second method, the "remainder reduction" 
method, is not complete in the above sense, but it seems
to give minimal (or almost minimal) tables for 
every kind of set.  The two techniques are applicable
directly to small sets.  Some methods to extend 
these results to larger sets are also presented.  A rough
comparison with ordinary hashing is given which 
shows that this method can be used conveniently
in several practical applications.

Anomalous Behavior of the Fifty-Percent
Rule in Dynamic Memory Allocation
.W
This paper reports simulation data showing
that, in dynamic memory allocation, the average 
free-to-allocated-block ratio can differ considerably
and in both directions from the predictions of 
the 50 percent rule.  A new derivation is given, and it
is shown that previous derivations make an assumption 
that may be violated frequently.  On the basis of the simulation
data and the derivation, it is hypothesized 
that the anomalous behavior results from the combined
effects of systematic placement and the statistics 
of the release process.  Additional simulations support
this hypothesis.  Systematic placement, which 
refers to the natural convention of always allocating
storage requests against the same end of the free 
block selected by the allocation strategy, tends to
order blocks within contiguous groups according to 
their allocation time.  The degree of anomalous behavior
depends on the extent to which allocated blocks 
are released in the order of their allocation.  For
non-Markovian release processes, the extent of the 
correlation between allocation order and release order
varies approximately inversely with the coefficient 
of variation of the memory residence time distribution.
 The simulations show that allocation efficiency 
depends strongly on the residence time distribution; efficiency
decreases as the distribution's coefficient 
of variation increases.  Some practical implications are briefly discussed.

A Fast String Searching Algorithm
.W
An algorithm is presented that searches for
the location, "i," of the first occurrence of a 
character string, "pat," in another string, "string."
 During the search operation, the characters of 
pat are matched starting with the last character of
pat.  The information gained by starting the match 
at the end of the pattern often allows the algorithm
to proceed in large jumps through the text being 
searched.  Thus the algorithm has the unusual property that,
in most cases, not all of the first i characters 
of string are inspected.  The number of characters actually
inspected (on the average) decreases as a 
function of the length of pat.  For a random English
pattern of length 5, the algorithm will typically 
inspect i/4 characters of string before finding a match at
i.  Furthermore, the algorithm has been implemented 
so that (on the average) fewer than i+patlen machine
instructions are executed.  These conclusions are 
supported with empirical evidence and a theoretical
analysis of the average behavior of the algorithm. 
 The worst case behavior of the algorithm is linear in
i+patlen, assuming the availability of array space 
for tables linear in patlen plus the size of the alphabet.

are critically reconsidered to single out a 
proper attitude and programming style for language allowing
direct control of nondeterministic features. 
 The proposed attitude aims at retaining the purity of
the nondeterministic formulation of search processes

of problem solving efforts to another (the 
choice level).  The feasibility of recognizing these two
levels is discussed, stressing that the structure

 The leaves are computational environments, 
each holding an alternative under inspection, while
the other nodes are associated with choice poin ts. 
 According to the proposed programming style, a generative
function is associated with each choice poin t, 
which expresses the desired choice strategy. The main
advantage on this approach is the localization 
of the search strategies: Each nonterminal node of the
tree keeps track of the state of the computation

holding at the same time the strategy to coordinate

High-Level Data Flow Analysis
.W
In contrast to the predominant use of low-level
in termediate text, high-level data flow analysis 
deals with programs essentially at source level and
exploits the control flow information implicit in 
the parse tree.  The need for high-level flow analysis
arises from several aspects of recent work on 
advanced methods of program certification and optimization.
 This paper proposes a simple general method 
of high-level data flow analysis that allows free use
of escape and jump statements, avoids large graphs 
when compiling large programs, facilitates updating of
data flow information to reflect program changes, 
and derives new global information helpful in solving
many familiar global flow analysis problems.  An 
illustrative application to live variable analysis is presented.
 Many of the graphs involved are constructed 
and analyzed before any programs are compiled, thus avoiding
certain costs that low-level methods incur 
repeatedly at compile time.

from serial sections, either to aid in the comprehension

a general solution to the problem of constructing 
a surface over a set of cross-sectional contours. 
This surface, to be composed of triangular tiles, 
is constructed by separately determining an optimal
surface between each pair of consecutive contours.
 Determining such a surface is reduced to the problem
of finding certain minimum cost cycles in a directed 
toroidal graph.  A new fast algorithm for finding such
cycles is utilized.  Also developed is a closed-form 
expression, in term of the number of contour poin ts, for
an upper bound on the number of operations required 
to execute the algorithm.  An illustrated example which
involves the construction of a minimum area surface

Hardware Estimation of a Process' Primary Memory Requirements
.W
A minor hardware extension to the Honeywell
6180 processor is demonstrated to allow the primary 
memory requirements of a process in Multics to be approximated.
 The additional hardware required for 
this estimate to be computed consists of a program accessible
register containing the miss rate of the 
associative memory used for page table words.  This
primary memory requirement estimate was employed 
in an experimental version of Multics to control the
level of multiprogramming in the system and to bill 
for memory usage.  The resulting system's tuning parameters
display configuration insensitivity, and
it is conjectured that the system would also track shifts
in the referencing characteristics of its workload 
and keep the system in tune.

An Analysis of Inline Substitution for a Structured Programming Language
.W
An optimization technique known as inline substitution
is analyzed.  The optimization consists 
of replacing a procedure invocation by a modified copy
of the procedure body.  The general problem of 
using inline substitution to minimize execution time
subject to size constrain ts is formulated, and an 
approximate algorithmic solution is proposed.  The algorithm
depends on run-time statistics about the 
program to be optimized.  Preliminary results for the
CLU structured programming language indicate that, 
in programs with a low degree of recursion, over 90
percent of all procedure calls can be eliminated, 
with little increase in the size of compiled code and a
small savings in execution time.  Other conclusions 
based on these results are also presented.

Logic and Programming Languages
.W
Logic has been long in terested in whether answers
to certain questions are computable in principle, 
since the outcome puts bounds on the possibilities of
formalization.  More recently, precise comparisons 
in the efficiency of decision methods have become available
through the developments in complexity theory. 
 These, however, are applications to logic, and a big question
is whether methods of logic have significance 
in the other direction for the more applied parts of
computability theory.  Programming languages offer 
an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization
is well advanced; however, the semantical theory 
can hardly be said to be complete.  Though we have
many examples, we have still to give wide-ranging 
mathematical answers to these queries:  What is a machine?
 What is a computable process?  How (or how 
well) does a machine simulate a process?  Programs naturally
enter in giving descriptions of processes. 
 The definition of the precise meaning of a program
then requires us to explain what are the objects 
of computation (in a way, the statics of the problem)
and how they are to be transformed (the dynamics). 
 So far the theories of automata and of nets, though
most in teresting for dynamics, have formalized only 
a portion of the field, and there has been perhaps too
much concentration on the finite-state and algebraic 
aspects.  It would seem that the understanding of higher-level
program features involves us with infinite 
objects and forces us to pass through several levels
of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to 
the final simulation on a real machine.  These levels
can be made mathematically exact if we can find 
the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures.
 The experience of many independent workers 
with the method of data types as lattices (or partial
orderings) under an information content ordering, 
and with their continuous mappings, has demonstrated the
flexibility of this approach in providing definitions 
and proofs, which are clean and without undue dependence

for general purpose discrete event simulation systems.
 Several exhibited a performance superior to that

which improves on two aspects of the best of the previously
published algorithms.  First, the new algorithm's 
performance is quite insensitive to skewed distributions,
and second, its worst-case complexity is O( 
n), where n is the number of events in the set.  Furthermore,
tests conducted to estimate the average 
complexity showed it to be nearly independent of n.

The language in which programs are written

Detailed analysis of the errors made by the subjects

shows that the subjects had difficulty manipulating

Programming is divided into three major categories
with increasing complexity of reasoning 
in program validation: sequential programming, multiprogramming,
and real-time programming.  By adhering

high-level language molded after this discipline, 
the complexity of reasoning about concurrency and execution

 This may be the only practical way to make real-time
systems analytically verifiable and ultimately 
reliable.  A possible discipline is outlined and

CLU is a new programming language designed to support
the use of abstractions in program construction. 
 Work in programming methodology has led to the realization
that three kinds of abstractions-procedural, 
control, and especially data abstractions-are useful
in the programming process.  Of these, only the 
procedural abstraction is supported well by conventional
languages, through the procedure or subroutine. 
control abstractions.  This paper provides an in troduction

means of programming examples, the utility of the three
kinds of abstractions in program construction

Abstraction and Verification in Alphard: Defining

The Alphard "form" provides the programmer with
a great deal of control over the implementation 
of abstract data types.  In this paper the abstraction techniques
are extended from simple data representation 
and function definition to the iteration statement, the
most important poin t of interaction between data 
and the control structure of the language itself.  A
means of specializing Alphard's loops to operate 
on abstract entities without explicit dependence on the
representation of those entities is in troduced. 
 Specification and verification techniques that allow
the properties of the generators for such iterations 
to be expressed in the form of proof rules are developed.
 Results are obtained that for common special 
cases of these loops are essentially identical to the
corresponding constructs in other languages.  A 
means of showing that a generator will terminate is also provided.

Aggregation is in troduced as an abstraction
which is important in conceptualizing the real 
world.  Aggregation transforms a relationship between
objects into a higher-level object.  A new data 
type, called aggregation, is developed which, under
certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies 
aggregation abstractions.  Relational databases defined
as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  To main tain well-definedness,
update operations on such databases must 
preserve two invariants.  Well-defined relations are
distinct from relations in third normal form.  It 
is shown that these notions are complementary and both are
important in database design.  A top-down 
methodology for database design is described which separates
decisions concerning aggregate structure 
from decisions concerning key identification.  It is
suggested that aggregate types, and other types 
which support real-world abstractions without in troducing
implementation detail, should be incorporated 
into programming languages.

trees and the overhead spent on building them are

use of the methods.  If insertion and subsequent 
queries are the only operations of in terest, then "pure"
AVL trees present the overall best qualities.

Achieving Specific Accuracy in Simulation Output Analysis
.W
This paper extends the use of the regenerative
property of queueing systems in the analysis 
of simulation output.  In particular, it describes a
sequential estimation method which when used with 
the regenerative property allows results to be obtained
with specified statistical accuracy.  This method 
includes a test to check the normality assumption on
which the sequential procedure relies.  The paper 
illustrates the method using the empty and idle state
as the regenerative state.  A second example then 
describes how using the most frequently entered state
as the regenerative state reduces the chance of 
making a costly error in a preliminary simulation run.
 The paper also described how a variance reduction 
method due to Page [9] can be used to obtain a specified
accuracy with considerably fewer job completions 
than are required when no variance reduction technique is applied.

SP/k: A System for Teaching Computer Programming
.W
SP/k is a compatible subset of the PL/I  language
that has been designed for teaching programming. 
The features of the SP/k language were chosen to encourage
structured problem solving by computers, to 
make the language easy to learn and use, to eliminate
confusing and redundant constructs, and to make 
the language easy to compile.  The resulting language
is suitable for in troducing programming concepts 
used in various applications, including business data
processing, scientific calculations and non-numeric 
computation.  SP/k is actually a sequence of language
subsets called SP/1, SP/2,...SP/8.  Each subset 
in troduces new programming language constructs while
retaining all the constructs of preceding subsets. 
Each subset is precisely defined and can be learned
or implemented without the following subsets.

Proof Techniques for Hierarchically Structured Programs

A method for describing and structuring programs
that simplifies proofs of their correctness

of which can be described by a self-contained nonprocedural

whether or not pages in the index are structured, and
whether or not keys are compressed.  The average

A progress report is presented of on-going
research efforts concerning human decision making 
under uncertainly and risk and human problem solving

 Although the vehicle of these investigations has 
been the game of poker, a conceptual framework has been

of applicability.  The models of human judgment, choice,
and decision making are incorporated in a large 
scale complex program.  They represent both descriptive

Effects of Chargeout on User/Manager Attitudes

The relationship of in ternal pricing systems
for computer services (chargeout systems) and 
user management attitudes about their computer-based
information systems is investigated. Evidence is 
provided that the relationship conforms to a general
pattern that would be expected from the hypothesis 
of the four stages of EDP growth [15].  The results also
indicate that the chargeout systems characteristic 
of advanced EDP stage environments are associated with
relatively high levels of positive user attitudes 
and marked increases in EDP training for users. Both factors
are important to the user/manager involvement 
necessary for effective control of computer-based systems.
 Development and main tenance of computer-based 
systems is asserted to be a category of organizational
change.  A "felt need" for the change on the part 
of the user/manager is prerequisite to any change taking
place.  The research methods of behavioral science

registers are used simultaneously? How many would 
be sufficient all of the time? Most of the time? What
would the overhead be if the number of registers

Effective Information Retrieval Using Term Accuracy
.W
The performance of information retrieval systems
can be evaluated in a number of different 
ways.  Much of the published evaluation work is based
on measuring the retrieval performance of an average 
user query.  Unfortunately, formal proofs are difficult
to construct for the average case.  In the present 
study, retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the
performance of a specific user query.  The concept 
of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability
of occurrence of a query term in the documents 
relevant to that query.  By relating term accuracy
to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the 
documents of a collection it is possible to give formal
proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a 
given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems
that have been used successfully in experimental 
situations.  Among these are inverse document frequency
weighting, thesaurus construction, and phrase 
generation.

Improving the Access Time for Random Access Files

Clustering in the key set is decreased by
smoothing the key-to-address transformation, and 
by adding shadow buckets to an open chaining file.  The
keys are pre-hashed before the address division, 
to remove the effect of sequential properties in the
key set.  Shadow buckets in the key search sequence 
reduce the effect of nonuniformity in file loading,
and decrease the number of maximum probes needed 
to locate a record.  The combined effects of these techniques
lead to improved file performance for secondary 
storage devices, as shown by empirical studies.

An investigation into the average queue size
for a certain class of queues has resulted in 
the formulation of linear programming problems which
are ill-conditioned in some cases.  In attempting 
to solve these linear programming models, using IBM's
MPS package, instances of cycling were encountered. 
 Small perturbations in the input data resulted in problems
which did not cycle.  This fact, plus several 
other observed phenomena suggest that the primary reason
that cycling is not known to occur more frequently 
is the round-off errors in the computations perturb
the problem sufficiently to prevent cycling (or at 
least to prevent indefinite cycling).  In one case maximizing
and minimizing an objective function subject 
to the same constrain t set was attempted, but MPS solved
only one of these while giving an indication

in terreference distance probabilities.  Two other pairs

Static measurements of the list structure of

to atoms are found to obey, roughly, Zipf's law, 
which governs word frequencies in natural languages; poin ters
to lists usually poin t to a location physically 
nearby in memory.  The use of such regularities in the
space-efficient representation of list structure 
is discussed.  Linearization of lists, whereby successive
cdrs (or cars) are placed in consecutive memory 
locations whenever possible, greatly strengthens the
observed regularity of list structure.  It is shown 
that under some reasonable assumptions, the entropy or
information content of a car-cdr pair in the programs 
measured is about 10 to 15 bits before linearization,

A Record and File Partitioning Model
.W
One of the main objectives in the design of
a file system is the reduction of storage and data 
transfer costs.  This paper presents a model in which
several  requests access the file system, and each 
request requires information from one or more variable
length data-items.  The probabilities of access 
and the distribution of each data-item's length are assumed
to be known, and to be mutually independent. 
The file system uses one or more storage devices, and
each record may be partitioned into subrecords 
that are stored on different devices.  One of the subrecords
is designated as the primary record; when 
a request for a record is made, the primary record is
first accessed, and other subrecords are accessed 
only if the pertinent information is not stored in the
primary record.  The model that is presented in 
this paper, both as a nonlinear programming model and
a mixed integer programming model, is a very general 
one; several types of file systems may be derived from
it by an appropriate selection of its parameters. 
 This model has already been used in the optimization of
library routines' storage at a large scale operating 
system.

Implications of Structured Programming for Machine Architecture
.W
Based on an empirical study of more than 10,000
lines of program text written in a GOTO-less 
language, a machine architecture specifically designed for
structured programs is proposed.  Since assignment, 
CALL, RETURN, and IF statements together account for
93 percent of all executable statements, special 
care is given to ensure that these statements can be implemented
efficiently.  A highly compact instruction 
encoding scheme is presented, which can reduce program
size by a factor of 3.  Unlike a Huffman code, 
which utilizes variable length fields, this method uses
only fixed length (1-byte) op code and address 
fields.  The most frequent instructions consist of a
single 1-byte field.  As a consequence, instruction 
decoding time is minimized, and the machine is
efficient with respect to both space and time.

Preserving Average Proximity in Arrays
.W
Programmers and data structure designers are often
forced to choose between alternative structures. 
 In storing these structures, preserving logical adjacencies
or "proximity" is usually an important consideration. 
 The combinatorial problem of storing arrays as various
kinds of list structures is examined.  Embeddings 
of graphs are used to model the loss of proximity involved
in such storage schemes, and an elementary 
proof that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with
bounded loss of proximity is presented.  Average 
loss of proximity is then considered, and it is shown
that arrays cannot be stored as linear lists with 
only bounded loss of average proximity, but can be so
stored in binary trees.  The former result implies, 
for instance, that row major order is an asymptotically
optimal storage strategy for arrays.

Management Utilization of Computers in American Local Governments
.W
Traditional concepts of management information
systems (MIS) bear little relation to the information 
systems currently in use by top management in most US local
governments.  What exists is management-oriented 
computing, involving the use of relatively unsophisticated
applications.  Despite the unsophisticated 
nature of these systems, management use of computing is
surprisingly common, but also varied in its extent 
among local governments.  Management computing is most
prevalent in those governments with professional 
management practices where top management is supportive
of computing and tends to control computing decisions 
and where department users have less control over design
and implementation activities.  Finally, management 
computing clearly has impacts for top managers, mostly
involving improvements in decision information.

This note describes two operators that respond
to step edges, but not to ramps.  The first 
is similar to the digital Laplacian, but uses the max, rather
than the sum, of the x and y second differences. 
 The second uses the difference between the mean and
median gray levels in a neighborhood.  The outputs 
obtained from these operators applied to a set of test
pictures are compared with each other and with 
the standard digital Laplacian and gradient.  A third
operator, which uses the distance between the center 
and centroid of a neighborhood as an edge value, is also
briefly considered; it turns out to be equivalent 
to one of the standard digital approximations to the gradient.

Is "Sometime" Sometimes Better than "Always"? (Intermittent
.W
This paper explores a technique for proving the
correctness and termination of programs simultaneously. 
 This approach, the intermittent-assertion method, involves
documenting the program with assertions that 
must be true at some time when control passes through
the corresponding point, but that need not be true 
every time.  The method, introduced by Burstall, promises
to provide a valuable complement to the more 
conventional methods.  The intermittent-assertion method
is presented with a number of examples of correctness 
and termination proofs.  Some of these proofs are markedly
simpler than their conventional counterparts. 
 On the other hand, it is shown that a proof of correctness
or termination by any of the conventional 
techniques can be rephrased directly as a proof using
intermittent assertions.  Finally, it is shown 
how the intermittent-assertion method can be applied
to prove the validity of program transformations 
and the correctness of continuously operating programs.

Relaxation Methods for Image Reconstruction
.W
The problem of recovering an image (a function
of two variables) from experimentally available 
integrals of its grayness over thin strips is of great
importance in a large number of scientific areas. 
 An important version of the problem in medicine is
that of obtaining the exact density distribution 
a system of linear inequalities.  The size and 
the sparsity of the resulting system (typically, 25,000
inequalities with fewer than 1 percent of the 
coefficients nonzero) makes methods using successive
relaxations computationally attractive, as compared 
to other ways of solving systems of inequalities. 
In this paper, it is shown that, for a consistent 
system of linear inequalities, any sequence of relaxarion parameters
lying strictly between 0 and 2 generates 
a sequence of vectors which converges to a solution.
 Under the same assumptions, for a system of linear 
equations, the relaxation method converges to the minimum
norm solution.  Previously proposed techniques
are shown to be special cases of our procedure with
different choices of relaxation parameters.  The 
practical consequences for image reconstruction of the
choice of the relaxation parameters are discussed.

An encryption method is presented with the novel
property that publicly revealing an encryption 
key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption
key.  This has two important consequences: (1) 
Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit
keys, since a message can be enciphered using 
an encryption key publicly revealed by the intended recipient.
 Only he can decipher the message, since 
only he knows the corresponding decryption key.  (2)
A message can be "signed" using a privately held 
decryption key.  Anyone can verify this signature using
the corresponding publicly revealed encryption 
key.  Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot
later deny the validity of his signature.  This 
has obvious applications in "electronic mail" and "electronic
funds transfer" systems.  A message is 
encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising
M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking 
the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly
specified product, n, of two large secret prime 
numbers p and q.  Decryption is similar;only a different,
secret, power d is used, where e * d = 1 (mod(p-1) 
* (q-1)).  the security of the system rests in part on
the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, 
n.

the use of algebraic axiomatizations can simplify 
the process of proving the correctness of an implementation
of an abstract data type.  Second, semi-automatic 
tools are described which can be used both to automate
such proofs of correctness and to derive an immediate 
implementation from the axioms.  This implementation
allows for limited testing of programs at design

 computer network include (1) transmission

this list of algorithms we add (6) reverse path 
forwarding, a broadcast routing method which exploits
routing procedures and data structures already 
available for packet switching.  Reverse path forwarding
is a practical algorithm for broadcast routing 
 in store-and-forward packet switching computer networks.
 The algorithm is described as being practical 
 because it is not optimal according to metrics developed

it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity

Optimizing Decision Trees Through Heuristically Guided Search

Optimal decision table conversion has been
tackled in the literature using two approaches, 
dynamic programming and branch-and-bound.  The former
technique is quite effective, but its time and 
space requirements are independent of how "easy" the
given table is.  Furthermore, it cannot be used 
to produce good, quasi optimal solutions.  The branch-and-bound
technique uses a good heuristic to direct 
the search, but is cluttered up by an enormous search
space, since the number of solutions increases 
with the number of test variables according to a double 
exponential.  In this paper we suggest a heuristically 
guided top-down search algorithm which, like dynamic
programming, recognizes identical subproblems but 
which can be used to find both optimal and quasi optimal
solutions.  The heuristic search method introduced 
in this paper combines the positive aspects of the above

the optimal set tab stops.  The use of fixed tab 
stops, as a heuristic alternative, can achieve
about 80 percent of optimal with no prepass.

Median Split Trees: A Fast Lookup Technique for Frequently Occuring Keys
.W
Split trees are a new technique for searching sets
of keys with highly skewed frequency distributions. 
 A split tree is a binary search tree each node of which
contains two key values-a node value which is 
a maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a split
value which partitions the remaining keys (with 
respect to their lexical ordering) between the left and
right subtrees.  A median split tree (MST) uses 
the lexical median of a node's descendents as its split
value to force the search tree to be perfectly 
balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation
of the tree and high search speed.  Unlike 
frequency ordered binary search trees, the cost of a
successful search of an MST is log n bounded and 
very stable around minimal values.  Further, an MST
can be built for a given key ordering and set of 
frequencies in time n log n, as opposed to n2 for an
optimum binary search tree.  A discussion of the 
application of MST's to dictionary lookup for English is

Distributed Processes: A Concurrent Programming Concept
.W
A language concept for concurrent processes
without common variables is introduced.  These 
processes communicate and synchronize by means of procedure
calls and guarded regions.  This concept 
is proposed for real-time applications controlled by
microcomputer networks with distributed storage. 
 The paper gives several examples of distributed processes
and shows that they include procedures, coroutines, 
classes, monitors, processes, semaphores, buffers, path
expressions, and input/output as special cases.

Using Synthetic Images to Register Real Images with Surface Models
.W
A number of image analysis tasks can benefit
from registration of the image with a model of 
the surface being imaged.  Automatic navigation using visible
light or radar images requires exact alignment 
of such images with digital terrain models.  In addition,
automatic classification of terrain, using 
satellite imagery, requires such alignment to deal correctly
with the effects of varying sun angle and 
surface slope.  Even inspection techniques for certain
industrial parts may be improved by this means. 
We achieve the required alignment by matching the real
image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface 
model and known positions of the light sources.  The
synthetic image intensity is calculated using the 
reflectance map, a convenient way of describing surface reflection
as a function of surface gradient. 
 We illustrate the technique using LANDSAT images and digital terrain models.

Simulation is presented as a practical technique

is described for constructing a detailed

a control stream replaces the instruction and 
data streams of the real system.  Simulation of the
system model yields the timing and resource usage 
statistics needed for performance evaluation, without
the necessity of emulating the system.  As a case 
study, the implementation of a simulator of a model
of the CPU-memory subsystem of the IBM 360/91 is 
described.  The results of evaluating some alternative
system designs are discussed.  The experiments 
reveal that, for the case study, the major bottlenecks
in the system are the memory unit and the fixed 
point unit.  Further, it appears that many of the sophisticated
pipelining and buffering technique simplemented

SEMBEGS is a complete batch environment graphical
system containing components for handling 
graphical data files, for displaying the contents of
these files on a variety of graphical hardware, 
and for performing graphical batch input operations.
 SEMBEGS is easy to extend and modify to meet the 
growing needs of a large batch environment, and is even
extendable to a fully interactive system.  The 
paper presents the conceptual view of graphics leading
to the design of SEMBEGS and outlines the major 
components of the system.  The design of SEMBEGS is founded
upon the basic assumption that the true aim 
of computer graphics is to describe graphical entities,
rather than, as commonly held, to provide graphical 
input and output functional capabilities.  SEMBEGS
is built around a Basic Graphical Data Management 
System (BAGDAMS) which provides a common means of communicating
the descriptions of graphical entities 
 between the various components of SEMBEGS.  BAGDAMS
provides facilities for storing, retrieving, and 
manipulating the descriptions of graphical entities
provided by, and received by application programs,

Cold-Start vs. Warm-Start Miss Ratios
.W
In a two-level computer storage hierarchy, miss
ratio measurements are often made from a "cold 
start," that is made with the first-level  store initially
empty.  For large capacities the effect on 
the measured miss ratio of the misses incurred while
filling the first-level store can be significant, 
even for long reference strings.  Use of "warm-start"
rather than "cold-start" miss ratios cast doubt 
on the widespread belief that the observed "S-shape" of
lifetime (reciprocal of miss ratio) versus capacity 
curve indicates a property of behavior of programs that
maintain a constant number of pages in main storage. 
 On the other hand, if cold-start miss ratios are measured
as a function of capacity and measurement 
length, then they are useful in studying systems in which
operation of a program is periodically interrupted 
by task switches.  It is shown how to obtain, under simple
assumptions, the cache miss ratio for multiprogramming 
from cold-start miss ratio values and how to obtain
approximate cold-start miss ratios from warm-start 
miss ratios.

 This is equivalent to placing k1 linearly ordered

a large scale.  These systems promise both financial 
benefits for the institutions that use them and potential

they also raise significant social, legal, and technical

they solve.  This paper examines the incentives for EFT
developments and the social problems they raise 
in the context of conflicts between five different value
positions that are often implicit in analyses 
of proposed EFT arrangements.  These conflicts reflect
the relative importance of certain problems for 
specific groups.  The value positions implicit in EFT proposals
help to organize analyses of market arrangements, 
system reliability, and privacy of transactions.  These
topics are analyzed in this article and related 
to the value positions held by concerned parties.  Last,
the ways in which the public can learn about

Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann
Style?  A Functional Style and Its Algebra

.W
Conventional programming languages are growing
ever more enormous, but not stronger.  Inherent 
defects at the most basic level cause them to be both
fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style 
of programming inherited from their common ancestor-the
properties for reasoning about programs. An 
alternative functional style of programming is founded
on the use of combining forms for creating programs. 
 Functional programs deal with structured data, are often
nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically 
constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require
the complex machinery of procedure declarations 
 Associated with the functional style of programming 
is an algebra of programs whose variables range over
programs and whose operations are combining forms. 
 This algebra can be used to transform programs and
to solve equations whose "unknowns" are programs 
in much the same way one transforms equations in high
school algebra.  These transformations are given 
by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language
classes of programs.  A new class of computing systems

A system for proving that programs written
in a high level language are correctly translated 
to a low level language is described.  A primary use of
the system is as a post optimization step in code 
generation.  The low level language programs need not
be generated by a compiler and in fact could be 
hand coded.  Examples of the usefulness of such a system
are given.  Some interesting results are the 
ability to handle programs that implement recursion by
bypassing the start of the program, and the detection 
and pinpointing of a wide class of errors in the low
level language programs.  The examples demonstrate 
that optimization of the genre of this paper can result
in substantially faster operation and the saving 
of memory in terms of program and stack sizes.

Shallow Binding in Lisp 1.5
.W
Shallow binding is a scheme which allows the
value of a variable to be accessed in a bounded 
amount of computation.  An elegant model for shallow binding
in  Lisp 1.5 is presented in which context-switching 
is an environment tree transformation called rerooting.
 Rerooting is completely general and reversible, 
and is optional in the sense that a Lisp 1.5 interpreter
will operate correctly whether or not rerooting 
is invoked one very context change.   Since rerooting
leaves assoc [v, a] invariant, for all variables 
v and all environments a, the programmer can have access
to a rerooting primitive, shallow[], which gives 
him dynamic control over whether accesses are shallow or
deep, and which affects only the speed of execution 
of a program, not its semantics.  In addition, multiple
processes can be active in the same environment 
structure, so long as rerooting is an indivisible operation.
 Finally, the concept of rerooting is shown 
to combine the concept of shallow binding in Lisp with
Dijkstra's display for Algol and hence is a general 
model for shallow binding.

that: (1) maintenance and enhancement do consume 
much of the total resources of systems and programming

(3) in maintenance and enhancement, problems of a management

Analyses of Deterministic Parsing Algorithms
.W
This paper describes an approach for determining
the minimum, maximum, and average times to 
parse sentences acceptable by a deterministic parser.
 These quantities are presented in the form of 
symbolic formulas, called time-formulas.  The variables
in these formulas represent not only the length 
of the input string but also the time to perform elementary
operations such as pushing, popping, subscripting, 
iterating, etc.  By binding to the  variables actual numerical
values corresponding to a given compiler-machine 
configuration, one can determine the execution time
for that configuration.  Time-formulas are derived 
by examining the grammar rules and the program representing
the algorithm one wishes to analyze.  The 
approach is described by using a specific grammar that defines
simple arithmetic expressions.  Two deterministic
parsers are analyzed: a top-down recursive descent
LL(1) parser, and a bottom-up SLR(1) parser.  The 
paper provides estimates for the relative efficiencies
of the two parsers.  The estimates applicable 
to a specific machine, the PDP-10, are presented and
substantiated buy benchmarks.  Finally, the paper 
illustrates the proposed approach by applying it to
the analyses of parsers for a simple programming 
language.

An Optimal Method for Deletion in One-Sided Height-Balanced Trees

A one-sided height-balanced tree is a binary
tree in which every node's right subtree has a 
height which is equal to or exactly one greater than the
height of its left subtree.  It has an advantage 
over the more general AVL tree in that only one bit
of balancing information is required (two bits are 
required for the ACL tree).  It is shown that deletion of
an arbitrary node of such a tree can be accomplished 
in O(logn) operations, where n is the number of nodes
in the tree.  Moreover the method is optimal in 
the sense that its complexity cannot be reduced in order
of magnitude.  This result, coupled with earlier 
results by Hirschberg, indicates that, of the three basic
problems of insertion, deletion, and retrieval, 
only insertion is adversely affected by this modification of an AVL tree.

Automatic Data Structure Selection: An Example and Overview

The use of several levels of abstraction has
proved to be very helpful in constructing and 
maintaining programs.  When programs are designed with abstract
data types such as sets and lists, programmer 
time can be saved by automating the process of filling
in low-level implementation details.  In the past, 
programming systems have provided only a single general
purpose implementation for an abstract type. 
 Thus the programs produced using abstract types were
then inefficient in space or time.  In this paper 
a system for automatically choosing efficient implementations
for abstract types from a library of implementations 
is discussed.  This process is discussed in detail for
an example program.  General issues in data structure 
selection are also reviewed.

Controlled sharing of information is needed and
desirable for many applications and is supported

paper shows how to extend programming languages

expression of access constraints on shared data. 
 Access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and
to objects that are components of larger objects, 
such as bank account records in a bank's data base.
 The constraints are stated declaratively, and can 
be enforced by static checking similar to type checking.
 The approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed 
language, but is particularly suitable for extending
languages that support the notion of abstract data 
types.

space requirements can be reduced to approximately

 Arrays of different sizes, a program stack, and

the differences between two files.  One application 
is the comparing of two versions of a source program
or other file in order to display all differences. 
 The algorithm isolates differences in a way that corresponds
closely to our intuitive notion of difference, 
is easy to implement, and is computationally efficient,
with time linear in the file length.  For most 
applications the algorithm isolates differences similar
to those isolated by the longest common subsequence. 
 Another application of this algorithm merges files
containing independently generated changes into a 
single file.  The algorithm can also be used to generate
efficient encodings of a file in the form of 
the differences between itself and a given "datum" file,
permitting reconstruction of the original file 
from the difference and datum files.

a nonsingular binary matrix.  Examples of 
complete enumeration of all 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 nonsingular
binary matrices were produced by mapping the

has application to the Vernam encipherment method 
using pseudorandom number sequences.  A bit string formed

can be used as a representation of a natural number. 
This natural number is transformed to a nonsingular

Interference Detection Among Solids and Surfaces
.W
In many industrial environments it is necessary to determine whether
r there is interference among components.  There are many potential
interference problems in products made up of assemblies of components 
and in product manufacturing and testing.  Typically, drawings
are used in an attempt to detect such unwanted interferences,
but the two-dimensional, static drafting medium does not always show
interferences among three-dimensional, moving parts.  This paper
 presents a computer representation for solids and surfaces and algorithms
which carry out interference checking among objects so represented.  
Objects are represented as polyhedra or as piecewise planar
surfaces.  Two types of interference checking are discussed:
detection of intersections among objects in fixed positions and detection
of collisions among objects moving along specified trajectories.

Over the past decade there has been a significant growth
in the use of computer technology by U.S. police departments.  This

a tool for decision making, strategic planning and person/machine

Due to the linear structure of source text, difficulties may arise in a

presented here which uses instead control structures, namely events

conceptually and in practice because he can forget these problems
at the outset and he avoids special processing for each problem.
This technique has been applied to the construction of an Algol

Global Optimization by Suppression of Partial Redundancies
.W
The elimination of redundant computations and the moving of invariant
computations out of loops are often done separately, with invariants 
moved outward loop by loop.  We propose to do both at once and
to move each expression directly to the entrance of the outermost
loop in which it is invariant.  This is done by solving a more
general problem, i.e. the elimination of computations performed
twice on a given execution path.  Such computations are termed partially
redundant.  Moreover, the algorithm does not require any graphical
information or restrictions on the shape of the program graph.
Testing this algorithm has shown that its execution cost is nearly
linear with the size of the program, and that it leads
to a smaller optimizer that requires less execution time.

Synchronization with Eventcounts and Sequencers

Synchronization of concurrent processes requires controlling the relative

A new synchronization mechanism is proposed, using 
abstract objects called eventcounts and sequencers, that allows processes
to control the ordering of events directly, rather than using mutual
exclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables that control
ordering of events.  Direct control of ordering seems to simplify
correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed
systems.  The mechanism is defined formally, and then several
examples of its use are given.  The relationship of the mechanism
to protection mechanisms in the system is explained; in particular,
eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement
of information matters.  An implementation of eventcount
s and sequencers in a system with shared memory is described.

Experiments with Some Algorithms that Find
.W
In two-class pattern recognition, it is a standard
technique to have an algorithm finding hyperplanes
which separates the two classes in a linearly separable training
set.  The traditional methods find a hyperplane which separates all
points in the other, but such a hyperplane is not necessarily centered
in the empty space between the two classes.  Since a central
hyperplane does not favor one class or the other, it should have
a lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore better
than a noncentral hyperplane.  Six algorithms for finding central
hyperplanes are tested on three data sets.  Although frequently
used practice, the modified relaxation algorithm is very poor. 
Three algorithms which are defined in the paper are found to be
quite good.

A Mathematical Programming Updating Method Using Modified

An efficient and numerically stable method is presented for the problem of
updating an orthogonal decomposition of a matrix of column (or row) vectors.
The fundamental idea is to add a column (or row) analogous
to adding an additional row of data in a linear least squares problem.
A column (or row) is dropped by a formal scaling with the
imaginary unit,  -1, followed by least squares addition of the column
(or row).  The elimination process for the procedure is successive
ssive application of the Givens transformation in modified (more efficient)
form.  These ideas are illustrated with an implementation
of the revised simplex method.  The algorithm is a general purpose
one that does not account for any particular structure or sparsity
in the equations.  Some suggested computational tests for determining
signs of various controlling parameters in the revised simplex
algorithm are mentioned.  A simple means of constructing
test cases and some sample computing times are presented.

reorganize the data into submatrix form and to use block multiplication

matrices stored in row-(or column-)oriented form.  An efficient
method for accomplishing this reorganization is given.  This also
makes possible the derivation of an asymptotically better bound
for multiplication of matrices given in row-oriented form by adapting
the technique of Strassen to the reorganized data.  The reorganization/block 
multiplication scheme is shown to be advantageous for
matrices and pages of realistic size; the Strassen adaptation is

alocation parameters on the expected response times under the two algorithms.
Numerical solutions and economical lower bounds for the

and a control component, which determines the problem-solving
strategies by means of which that knowledge is used.  The logic component
determines the meaning of the algorithm whereas the control
component only affects its efficiency.  The efficiency of an
algorithm can often by improving the control component without changing
the logic of the algorithm.  We argue that computer programs would
be more often correct and more easily improved and modified if
their logic and control aspects were identified and separated in
the program text.

The algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure
of a symmetric Boolean matrix.  We assume that the processors have
access to a common memory.  Simultaneous access to the same location
is permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions.

Proving Termination with Multiset Orderings
.W
A common tool for proving the termination of programs is the well-founded
set, a set ordered in such a way as to admit no infinite descending sequences.
The basic approach is to find a termination function  that maps
the values of the program variables into some well-founded set,
such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reduced
throughout the computation.  All too often, the termination functions required 
are difficult to find and are of a complexity out
of proportion to the program under consideration. Multisets (bags)
over a given well-founded set S are sets that admit multiple occurrences
of elements taken from S.  The given ordering on S induces
an ordering on the finite multisets over S.  This multiset ordering
is shown to be well-founded.  The multiset ordering enables the
use of relatively simple and intuitive termination functions in otherwise
difficult termination proofs.  In particular, the multiset
ordering is used to prove the termination of production systems,
programs defined in terms of sets of rewriting rules.

An algorithm for inserting an element into a one-sided height-balanced

gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should
be the first examples of their kind, where deletion has a smaller time 
complexity than insertion.  Furthermore, it can now be concluded
that insertion, deletion, and retrieval in OSHB trees can
be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for
the more general AVL trees, to within a constant factor.  However,
the insertion and deletion algorithms for OSHB trees appear much
more complicated than the corresponding algorithms for AVL trees.

The approximation of polygonal thematic maps by cellular
maps, an important operation in geographical data processing,
is analyzed.  The data organization used for representing the polygonal
maps is a widely used segment-based data structure, where class
labels identify the regions bordering each segment on either side.
The approximation algorithm presented operates on such an
organization, eliminating the need for the recognition of region boundaries.
Each segment is examined only once.  The versatility of
the new organization is further illustrated by the outline of algorithms
for area computation and point inclusion.  The algorithm is
applied to a set of soil maps converted to computer-readable
form by means of a coordinate digitizer.

Four algorithms for the numerical computation
of the standard deviation of (unweighted) sampled data
are analyzed.  Two of the algorithms are well-known in the statistical

specifically intended for automatic computation.  Our discussion is 
expository, with emphasis on reaching a suitable definition of
"accuracy."  Each of the four algorithms is analyzed for the conditions
under which it will be accurate.  We conclude that all four
algorithms will provide accurate answers for many problems, but two
of the algorithms, one new, one old, are substantially more accurate

This paper describes a collision avoidance algorithm
for planning a safe path for a polyhedral object moving among

so that they represent the locus of forbidden positions for an arbitrary
reference point on the moving object.  A trajectory of this
reference point which avoids all forbidden regions is free of collisions.
Trajectories are found by searching a network which indicates, for each vertex 
in the transformed obstacles, which other vertices can be reached safely.

Breaking Substitution Ciphers Using a Relaxation Algorithm

Substitution ciphers are codes in which each letter
of the alphabet has one fixed substitute, and the word divisions 
do not change.  In this paper the problem of breaking substitution
ciphers is represented as a probabilistic labeling problem.
Every code letter is assigned probabilities of representing plain text
letters.  These probabilities are updated in parallel for all
code letters, using joint letter probabilities.  Iterating the updating
scheme results in improved estimates that finally lead to
breaking the cipher.  The method is applies successfully to two examples.

each an integer between 0 and N - 1.  The method requires 0(n) w
words of storage and allows O(logn N) access time.  Although our method
is a little complicated to use in practice, our analysis shows
why a simpler algorithm used for compressing LR parsing tables works so well.

fraud, theft, embezzlement - the characteristics of the crimes
are new. The changes resulting from the accelerating use of EFTs and 
its continual technological advances broaden the scope of security

   MANIP: A Computer System for Algebra and Analytic Differentiation
.W
   A mathematical expression to be operated upon is written in FORTRAN-like 
notation and stored in the computer as a string of BCD characters with all
blanks removed. It may be as complicated as desired (parentheses nested without
restriction, etc.) so long as the entire expression (or any subsequent form)
does not exceed 5000 characters. The problemm of performing algebraic operations
and obtaining analytic derivatives was translated into that of identifying and
manipulating character sequences. Programs which resulted were written in
FORTRAN IV for a CDC 3600 and are discussed in detail.

   GRAD Assistant - A Program for Symbolic Algebraic Manipulation and 
Differentiation
.W
   The General Recursive Algebra and Differentiation Assistant (GRAD Assistant)
now under development is a set of LISP functions which symbolically manipulate
abd differentiate algebraic expressions. It is designed for use with problemms 
in which a large amount of routine manipulation is to be done by a program 
without human intervention. Thus, GRAD must recognize necessary simplifications
without external guidance. While some complicated expressions (notably ones
involving nested radicals and trigonometric functions) do not yield completely
to the present version, it has proved quite useful indeed.

   An On-Line Program for Non-Numerical Algebra
.W
   The goal of this program is to make a step toward te design of an automated
mathematical assistant. Some requirements for such a program are: it must be
easy to access, and that the result must be obtained in a reasonably short
time. Accordingly the program is written for a time-shared computer. The Q-32
chosen because it also had a LISP 1.5 compiler. Programming and debugging was
done from a remote teletype console at Stanford University.
